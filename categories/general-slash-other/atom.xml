    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while ago I posted a set review of sorts for Ravnica. This is a bit of a follow up. Now that the set has been out a while I have more data to work with as far as experience playing with the cards goes. I also think I&rsquo;ve figured out what a few of the set&rsquo;s sleepers are. Once again I&rsquo;ll be ignoring insignificant or limited only cards and very obvious cards. You don&rsquo;t need me to tell you that <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Birds%20of%20Paradise&options=" data-card="Birds of Paradise">Birds of Paradise</a> is good, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Watchwolf&options=" data-card="Watchwolf">Watchwolf</a> is very aggressivly costed, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Caregiver&options=" data-card="Caregiver">Caregiver</a> is bad. Also if I have nothing new to say since the last review I will leave it out here.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bathe%20in%20Light&options=" data-card="Bathe in Light">Bathe in Light</a><br/>
This has turned out to be quite a nice little trick. While nothing amazing it is certainly playable in casual, especially multiplayer. It does have a bit of tournament value as well. One of its major bonus' is that it can make Auras fall off your creatures. Since cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Threads%20of%20Disloyalty&options=" data-card="Threads of Disloyalty">Threads of Disloyalty</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Faith&rsquo;s%20Fetters&options=" data-card="Faith&amp;rsquo;s Fetters">Faith&rsquo;s Fetters</a> are seeing play this is significant. It also can be a nice <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Falter&options=" data-card="Falter">Falter</a> for breaking through stalemates.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bloodbond%20March&options=" data-card="Bloodbond March">Bloodbond March</a><br/>
This has been a bit disappointing in testing. While on paper I thought it looked like a solid engine for a casual deck after testing it I have decided it is in fact a piece of crap. I&rsquo;ve had better experiences with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Disturbed%20Burial&options=" data-card="Disturbed Burial">Disturbed Burial</a>. It will see a lot of casual play anyway.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bloodletter%20Quill&options=" data-card="Bloodletter Quill">Bloodletter Quill</a><br/>
This is actually pretty decent but not as decent as <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jushi%20Apprentice&options=" data-card="Jushi Apprentice">Jushi Apprentice</a>. Maybe it will see play in block or after Kamigawa block rotates out.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boros%20Fury-Shield&options=" data-card="Boros Fury-Shield">Boros Fury-Shield</a><br/>
This was seeing play for about a week. Then people realized this is just a bad <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shining%20Shoal&options=" data-card="Shining Shoal">Shining Shoal</a>. Even casual players are generally better off with something like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kor%20Chant&options=" data-card="Kor Chant">Kor Chant</a> which can actually kill things.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boros%20Garrison&options=" data-card="Boros Garrison">Boros Garrison</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dimir%20Aqueduct&options=" data-card="Dimir Aqueduct">Dimir Aqueduct</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Golgari%20Rot%20Farm&options=" data-card="Golgari Rot Farm">Golgari Rot Farm</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Selesnya%20Sanctuary&options=" data-card="Selesnya Sanctuary">Selesnya Sanctuary</a><br/>
I dismissed these as mediocre until I actually played with them. My opinion then became that they are decent. After playing even more with them I think they might actually be amazing. They are even seeing heavy tournament play as they take a lot of the sting out of cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Suppression%20Field&options=" data-card="Suppression Field">Suppression Field</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hokori&options=" data-card="Hokori">Hokori</a>. They will likely also keep <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Weathered%20Wayfarer&options=" data-card="Weathered Wayfarer">Weathered Wayfarer</a> from seeing much use.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boros%20Signet&options=" data-card="Boros Signet">Boros Signet</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dimir%20Signet&options=" data-card="Dimir Signet">Dimir Signet</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Golgari%20Signet&options=" data-card="Golgari Signet">Golgari Signet</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Selesnya%20Signet&options=" data-card="Selesnya Signet">Selesnya Signet</a><br/>
These also wound up much better than I thought they would be. While not amazing by any means after testing them I&rsquo;ve decided they are slightly better than the <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Talisman%20of%20Dominance&options=" data-card="Talisman of Dominance">Talismans</a>.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boros%20Swiftblade&options=" data-card="Boros Swiftblade">Boros Swiftblade</a><br/>
Have you seen what happens when this guy picks up a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Umezawa&rsquo;s%20Jitte&options=" data-card="Umezawa&amp;rsquo;s Jitte">Jitte</a>? He kills in two attack phases.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Carven%20Caryatid&options=" data-card="Carven Caryatid">Carven Caryatid</a><br/>
Most definitely good but a good portion of the aggro decks rely on small flyers like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Suntail%20Hawk&options=" data-card="Suntail Hawk">Suntail Hawk</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Leonin%20Skyhunter&options=" data-card="Leonin Skyhunter">Leonin Skyhunter</a>, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hypnotic%20Specter&options=" data-card="Hypnotic Specter">Hypnotic Specter</a>. As long as they do this wont be living up to its full potential. Will likely have more success in Extended especially since <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wall%20of%20Blossoms&options=" data-card="Wall of Blossoms">Wall of Blossoms</a> just left.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Char&options=" data-card="Char">Char</a><br/>
This is seeing quite a bit of play in the Boros decks. The argument is generally between this and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shock&options=" data-card="Shock">Shock</a>. The smaller spell is better in the mirror and against <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Birds%20of%20Paradise&options=" data-card="Birds of Paradise">Birds of Paradise</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hypnotic%20Specter&options=" data-card="Hypnotic Specter">Hypnotic Specter</a> but <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Char&options=" data-card="Char">Char</a> is better against control where it can go to the dome for extra reach. The fact that it kills <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Meloku%20the%20Clouded%20Mirror&options=" data-card="Meloku the Clouded Mirror">Meloku</a> is very significant.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Circu,%20Dimir%20Lobotomist&options=" data-card="Circu, Dimir Lobotomist">Circu, Dimir Lobotomist</a><br/>
This has proven to be a casual play only card. While it still looks like fun it is very unreliable and too easy to kill to be competitive.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cloudstone%20Curio&options=" data-card="Cloudstone Curio">Cloudstone Curio</a><br/>
I had figured out this combo with this and 2 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Crimson%20Kobolds&options=" data-card="Crimson Kobolds">Kobolds</a> to pump the storm count and finish with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Brain%20Freeze&options=" data-card="Brain Freeze">Brain Freeze</a> or <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tendrils%20of%20Agony&options=" data-card="Tendrils of Agony">Tendrils</a> and was happy that I had thought of something original. The very next day there was a list for that same deck on Brainburst. The day after that Starcity Games posted a different version. So much for me being original.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Concerted%20Effort&options=" data-card="Concerted Effort">Concerted Effort</a><br/>
Casual players were hyping this up quite a bit. It is crap though so don&rsquo;t buy into it.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dark%20Confidant&options=" data-card="Dark Confidant">Dark Confidant</a><br/>
This guy popped up in quite a few decks at States. He is dangerous but extremely powerful. We&rsquo;ll see how well those black decks do from here on. I did see him in decks with expensive cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ink-Eyes,%20Servant%20of%20Oni&options=" data-card="Ink-Eyes, Servant of Oni">Ink-Eyes</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kokusho,%20the%20Evening%20Star&options=" data-card="Kokusho, the Evening Star">Kokusho</a> which I would be too afraid to try. Then again I&rsquo;m afraid of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Flesh%20Reaver&options=" data-card="Flesh Reaver">Flesh Reaver</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Phyrexian%20Negator&options=" data-card="Phyrexian Negator">Phyrexian Negator</a>. I think it would be good in a deck like Machine Head.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Darkblast&options=" data-card="Darkblast">Darkblast</a><br/>
This probably wont make a large impact in Standard but expect to see a few copies in Extended, Vintage, and Legacy decks. It is basically the new <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lava%20Dart&options=" data-card="Lava Dart">Lava Dart</a> in those formats.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dimir%20Cutpurse&options=" data-card="Dimir Cutpurse">Dimir Cutpurse</a><br/>
This combines with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hypnotic%20Specter&options=" data-card="Hypnotic Specter">Hypnotic Specter</a> as three drops a control deck never wants to see resolve. A number of B/U aggro decks made top 8 at States and most ran this guy.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dimir%20Doppelganger&options=" data-card="Dimir Doppelganger">Dimir Doppelganger</a><br/>
This is actually quite good. It is a great reanimator engine and also has potential to do a lot of other wacky things like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Volrath&rsquo;s%20Shapeshifter&options=" data-card="Volrath&amp;rsquo;s Shapeshifter">Volrath&rsquo;s Shapeshifter</a> did. I imagine this will see a lot of casual play and was also in a few reanimator decks in States.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dimir%20House%20Guard&options=" data-card="Dimir House Guard">Dimir House Guard</a><br/>
This saw a bit of play at States. He just Transmutes into so many neat things like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cranial%20Extraction&options=" data-card="Cranial Extraction">Cranial Extraction</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gifts%20Ungiven&options=" data-card="Gifts Ungiven">Gifts Ungiven</a>. Not too exciting as a creature in constructed though.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Doubling%20Season&options=" data-card="Doubling Season">Doubling Season</a><br/>
I still like this card and haven&rsquo;t tried it yet. A lot of other causal players are though and it seems to be a nice casual staple. Don&rsquo;t expect it to see any tournament play though.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Drift%20of%20Phantasms&options=" data-card="Drift of Phantasms">Drift of Phantasms</a><br/>
This is seeing a lot of play even in decks without many things to transmute into. It is great at blocking small flyers which is a nice thing to do right now. It also finds <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Threads%20of%20Disloyalty&options=" data-card="Threads of Disloyalty">Threads of Disloyalty</a>.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Elves%20of%20Deep%20Shadow&options=" data-card="Elves of Deep Shadow">Elves of Deep Shadow</a><br/>
Combines with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Birds%20of%20Paradise&options=" data-card="Birds of Paradise">Birds of Paradise</a> to maximize those chances of a turn 2 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hypnotic%20Specter&options=" data-card="Hypnotic Specter">Hypnotic Specter</a>.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Eye%20of%20the%20Storm&options=" data-card="Eye of the Storm">Eye of the Storm</a><br/>
This was originally thought to be a casual only card. Then was going to be the engine for the next <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Heartbeat%20of%20Spring&options=" data-card="Heartbeat of Spring">Heartbeat of Spring</a> combo deck. Then people realized the Heartbeat decks kill without this and just left it out. Back to casual only.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Faith&rsquo;s%20Fetters&options=" data-card="Faith&amp;rsquo;s Fetters">Faith&rsquo;s Fetters</a><br/>
This is a sleeper hit. It looks quite bad. Four mana for 4 life and a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pacifism&options=" data-card="Pacifism">Pacifism</a> doesn&rsquo;t look good but this is probably the best answer to <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Umezawa&rsquo;s%20Jitte&options=" data-card="Umezawa&amp;rsquo;s Jitte">Jitte</a> in the environment. It not only renders it useless but leaving it in play is quite significant. If you had just killed it with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Terashi&rsquo;s%20Grasp&options=" data-card="Terashi&amp;rsquo;s Grasp">Terashi&rsquo;s Grasp</a> they would likely just drop a new one and continue beating. With the old one still there the legend rule would prevent them from easily replacing it. It essentially nullifies two <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Umezawa&rsquo;s%20Jitte&options=" data-card="Umezawa&amp;rsquo;s Jitte">Jittes</a> with one Aura. Gaining 4 life against WW doesn&rsquo;t hurt either.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Firemane%20Angel&options=" data-card="Firemane Angel">Firemane Angel</a><br/>
I didn&rsquo;t think this was very good on paper. Six mana for a 4/3 Flying First Striker doesn&rsquo;t seem very exciting. The reanimation ability is so expensive that it will only be relevant once every three games or so. However It is still probably one of the best finishers the R/W control deck has right now. I would have liked an extra toughness to bring it out of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lightning%20Helix&options=" data-card="Lightning Helix">Lightning Helix</a> range though.</p>

There is a Japanese deck based around this card. If the Japanese are using it that is a good sign that it doesn&rsquo;t suck. They tend to be ahead of the game at deckbuilding. Will never even be considered in any format <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Opposition&options=" data-card="Opposition">Opposition</a> is legal in though.</p>

This can be amazing or just solid. This will see huge amounts of casual play and possibly some tournament play. It has popped up in a States list or two.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Glimpse%20the%20Unthinkable&options=" data-card="Glimpse the Unthinkable">Glimpse the Unthinkable</a><br/>
This is finally starting to drop in price but is still not an affordable card. It is seeing the most play now as a reanimator enabler since the mill deck is balls in constructed. I did see a few reanimator decks in the States results so this is the closest the deck has been to viable in Standard in a long time.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Golgari%20Grave-Troll&options=" data-card="Golgari Grave-Troll">Golgari Grave-Troll</a>
This hasn&rsquo;t caught on yet. I&rsquo;m almost positive it will eventually even if just in causal play. Dredge.dec made some appearances at States but I didn&rsquo;t see too many running this guy. I think that he&rsquo;ll start to pop up a bit more eventually. This will likely be a sleeper hit.</p>

This is about as good as it looks. A great engine for a slow beatdown deck like the Rock.</p>

This can be a wrecking ball in casual. The fact that even if you aren&rsquo;t blowing up lands he is still aggressively costed makes him that much better. These can be great equalizers for all those multicolored lands that are popping up.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hunted%20Dragon&options=" data-card="Hunted Dragon">Hunted Dragon</a><br/>
This is the only Hunted creature that has proved worth it. It is even quite solid.</p>

This was in a very large numbers of decks when people first started testing for States. Then after playtesting everyone started removing them and ranting about how horrible they were. Turns out a 4/4 isn&rsquo;t something you want your opponent to have.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hunted%20Horror&options=" data-card="Hunted Horror">Hunted Horror</a><br/>
This is seeing play in causal with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Brand&options=" data-card="Brand">Brand</a>. While that can be amazing you tend to not have both by turn 2 with any kind of regularity.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Last%20Gasp&options=" data-card="Last Gasp">Last Gasp</a><br/>
This is the best mono-black removal spell in at least 2-3 years. You have to go back to <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Smother&options=" data-card="Smother">Smother</a> and possibly even <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Diabolic%20Edict&options=" data-card="Diabolic Edict">Diabolic Edict</a> to find a better one. It doesn&rsquo;t kill <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Meloku%20the%20Clouded%20Mirror&options=" data-card="Meloku the Clouded Mirror">Meloku</a> though so it isn&rsquo;t perfect.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Life%20from%20the%20Loam&options=" data-card="Life from the Loam">Life from the Loam</a><br/>
I really like this card. It just does so much. It not only is a nice engine on its own but also combines nicely with cycling lands and the cycle of threshold lands from Odyssey. Still doesn&rsquo;t make <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Nomad%20Stadium&options=" data-card="Nomad Stadium">Nomad Stadium</a> playable though. Unfortunately it costs way to much for me to get some. This will be the big sleeper hit of the set. Expect it to be selling for $8-10 in the near future.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lightning%20Helix&options=" data-card="Lightning Helix">Lightning Helix</a><br/>
This is the main removal spell of the environment. It has been a while since those 3-toughness creatures were in this much trouble.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Overgrown%20Tomb&options=" data-card="Overgrown Tomb">Overgrown Tomb</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sacred%20Foundry&options=" data-card="Sacred Foundry">Sacred Foundry</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Temple%20Garden&options=" data-card="Temple Garden">Temple Garden</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Watery%20Grave&options=" data-card="Watery Grave">Watery Grave</a><br/>
Just like everyone knew they would these are the most important cards of the set in Standard and Extended. They will likely continue to be as long as they are legal. I would like to see them drop to $15 like a normal chase rare though.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plague%20Boiler&options=" data-card="Plague Boiler">Plague Boiler</a><br/>
People are still finding out if this is good or not. My testing has shown it to be kinda meh but I haven&rsquo;t tried it too much.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Putrefy&options=" data-card="Putrefy">Putrefy</a><br/>
This is still my favorite card in the set. It is seeing play in every deck that can conceivably cast in and some care splashing for it. One of the best removal spells ever printed and still my vote for best card in the set.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Razia,%20Boros%20Archangel&options=" data-card="Razia, Boros Archangel">Razia, Boros Archangel</a><br/>
This is extremely expensive, multicolored, and has the creature type, Angel. This all but guarantees it to see large amounts of casual play. This is also popping up in reanimator decks though.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Remand&options=" data-card="Remand">Remand</a><br/>
Not <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Memory%20Lapse&options=" data-card="Memory Lapse">Memory Lapse</a> but still a great tempo card. It buys the time you need for the slow control decks to take over.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Savra,%20Queen%20of%20the%20Golgari&options=" data-card="Savra, Queen of the Golgari">Savra, Queen of the Golgari</a><br/>
I haven&rsquo;t seen it in action yet but it is seeing a lot of casual play. Casual players love sacrificing their creatures so it was kind of obvious.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Searing%20Meditation&options=" data-card="Searing Meditation">Searing Meditation</a><br/>
This is much better than it looks. You can&rsquo;t discount cards like this since <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lightning%20Rift&options=" data-card="Lightning Rift">Lightning Rift</a> proved so amazing. This isn&rsquo;t as good since its deck doesn&rsquo;t feed itself but I&rsquo;ve been working on this one and it has been performing quite well.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shadow%20of%20Doubt&options=" data-card="Shadow of Doubt">Shadow of Doubt</a><br/>
I still love this card. It saw a bit of play but most people were eventually removing them for <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Remand&options=" data-card="Remand">Remand</a> which actually plays quite similarly but isn&rsquo;t as narrow. It now really only sees play in sideboards as <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Remand&options=" data-card="Remand">Remand</a> #5-8.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sisters%20of%20Stone%20Death&options=" data-card="Sisters of Stone Death">Sisters of Stone Death</a><br/>
Another reanimator target for a casual deck. This is seeing quite a bit of casual play. I doubt it will see much use even in reanimator when it comes to tournament play though.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Stinkweed%20Imp&options=" data-card="Stinkweed Imp">Stinkweed Imp</a><br/>
Don&rsquo;t be supprised if this sees tournament play. The dredge mechanic is very powerful if a bit slow and this is one of the better enablers for it. It popped up in a decklist or two at States.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sunforger&options=" data-card="Sunforger">Sunforger</a><br/>
This is seeing a bit of tournament play. I think the Fungus Fire decks that are using it are piles of crap but they supposedly doing quite well on Magic Online and did get a few States top 8s. The card is quite cool though.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Suppression%20Field&options=" data-card="Suppression Field">Suppression Field</a><br/>
This was hyped to be amazing and people were removing Jitte from their WW deck to play this. Then it was shown to be annoying but not impossible to play around. The problem is that is doesn&rsquo;t make <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Meloku%20the%20Clouded%20Mirror&options=" data-card="Meloku the Clouded Mirror">Meloku</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Umezawa&rsquo;s%20Jitte&options=" data-card="Umezawa&amp;rsquo;s Jitte">Jitte</a> suck. It just makes them balanced. They should have had higher activation costs to begin with so this just makes them fair. You know a card is broken when you can triple the mana you need to spend on it and it is still amazing.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Szadek,%20Lord%20of%20Secrets&options=" data-card="Szadek, Lord of Secrets">Szadek, Lord of Secrets</a><br/>
Casual players haven&rsquo;t really used him much yet but I expect that to change over time. He is just a perfect example of a card a casual player would love.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ursapine&options=" data-card="Ursapine">Ursapine</a><br/>
This is seeing a bit of casual play. I think it is decent but there are better things you can do with 5 mana.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vinelasher%20Kudzu&options=" data-card="Vinelasher Kudzu">Vinelasher Kudzu</a><br/>
This card is AMAZING! The more I test him the better he looks. I&rsquo;m getting to the point where I think he might be better than <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Quirion%20Dryad&options=" data-card="Quirion Dryad">Quirion Dryad</a>. It is fun to drop him on turn 2 and attack with a 5/5 on turn 3. Expect this to go up in price.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vitu-Ghazi,%20the%20City-Tree&options=" data-card="Vitu-Ghazi, the City-Tree">Vitu-Ghazi, the City-Tree</a><br/>
This is the win condition in the terrible looking Fungus Fire decks. Other than that I haven&rsquo;t seen much of it. It is pretty expensive to use.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this article I&rsquo;ll be taking a look at the soon to be released Ravnica: City of Guilds set and touch on some of the cards I find to be either interesting or useful.  Also since I&rsquo;ve actually been doing pretty well at predicting some of the cards that eventually wind up expensive over the last few sets I&rsquo;ll be mentioning some of the cards I feel might go up in price after the set has been out a while.  I was able to buy my copies of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vedalken%20Shackles&options=" data-card="Vedalken Shackles">Vedalken Shackles</a> for $2.00 each and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Beacon%20of%20Creation&options=" data-card="Beacon of Creation">Beacon of Creation</a> for $1 each while both cards are well over $5 now.  This can be helpful not only for not having to try and get the cards when they are so expensive but also the fact that you could possibly make a profit on them and sell them or trade them for other cards when they are worth much more than you paid for them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using the <a href="http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/showthread.php?t=13275">full spoiler at MTG Salvation</a> for this article so if there is a mistake there it might affect things.  I wont be looking at every card but just the ones that I have something to say about.  Also I wont really be looking at limited for these reviews.  If I included limited many of the cards that are only applicable there would be very boring to read about.  How many times do you need someone to tell you that a 3/3 flyer for 5 with a semi-relevant ability is pretty good in limited?  I&rsquo;ll leave those types of reviews to people who actually don&rsquo;t suck at limited.  I&rsquo;ll also be concentrating a bit more on casual play than tournaments (that is what we play after all).</p>

<p>The links wont work until Wizards adds the cards to <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp">Gatherer</a> but I figured I should add them now anyway.</p>

<h2>White:</h2>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Auratouched%20Mage&options=" data-card="Auratouched Mage">Auratouched Mage</a><br/>
Probably not very good but as with any card that tutors for something and puts it directly into play it needs to be looked at.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if this actually wound up decent at least in casual play when you can throw a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mythic%20Proportions&options=" data-card="Mythic Proportions">Mythic Proportions</a> on it for a 11/11 Trample for 5W.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Blazing%20Archon&options=" data-card="Blazing Archon">Blazing Archon</a><br/>
Not worth the cost but possibly a good reanimator target against aggro decks.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hunted%20Lammasu&options=" data-card="Hunted Lammasu">Hunted Lammasu</a><br/>
I like the Hunted creature cycle.  They are extremely undercosted for the drawback of giving your opponent dudes as well.  If you can handle the 4/4 a 5/5 Flyer for 4 mana is nothing short of amazing.  This is one of the less good Hunted creatures though as a 4/4 is not easy to deal with.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Three%20Dreams&options=" data-card="Three Dreams">Three Dreams</a><br/>
While Auras are in general weak cards and 5 mana is a lot this is massive card advantage in a color that has almost none.</p>

<h2>Blue:</h2>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Compulsive%20Research&options=" data-card="Compulsive Research">Compulsive Research</a><br/>
The Sorcery speed hurts it but this is still a fine card and given that <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thirst%20for%20Knowledge&options=" data-card="Thirst for Knowledge">Thirst for Knowledge</a> is rotating out and there is no instant speed card drawing in 9th this is one of the better options out there.  The actual effect is much better than Thirst (unless you are running <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblin%20Welder&options=" data-card="Goblin Welder">Goblin Welder</a> or something) as not every deck runs enough artifacts to make that good but all decks run land.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Copy%20Enchantment&options=" data-card="Copy Enchantment">Copy Enchantment</a><br/>
Certainly not good but I just wanted to comment that I&rsquo;m surprised it took this long for them to print this.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Eye%20of%20the%20Storm&options=" data-card="Eye of the Storm">Eye of the Storm</a><br/>
Seven mana is a lot but Holy Crap look at that effect.  It basically turns every Instant and sorcery you play into an Epic spell without that &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t Play Spells&rdquo; drawback.  The manacost will keep it casual only though.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Followed%20Footsteps&options=" data-card="Followed Footsteps">Followed Footsteps</a><br/>
This looks like a lot of fun.  Copying creatures is fun so making a bunch of copies will likely be even more fun.  Not a tournament card though as it does nothing until your upkeep and the creature may die before then.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hunted%20Phantasm&options=" data-card="Hunted Phantasm">Hunted Phantasm</a><br/>
This is much better than the White Hunted creature.  While I doubt it will see play outside of casual this was the color of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Prodigal%20Sorcerer&options=" data-card="Prodigal Sorcerer">Tims</a> so 1/1s aren&rsquo;t that hard to deal with and the reward is quite satisfying.  An unblockable 4/6 for three mana is quite the deal.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Telling%20Time&options=" data-card="Telling Time">Telling Time</a><br/>
It&rsquo;s not as good as either <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Brainstorm&options=" data-card="Brainstorm">Brainstorm</a> or <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Impulse&options=" data-card="Impulse">Impulse</a> but it is still an extremely solid card.  Will likely be included in any blue decks that pop up in Standard and Block while it is legal and since <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Brainstorm&options=" data-card="Brainstorm">Brainstorm</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Accumulated%20Knowledge&options=" data-card="Accumulated Knowledge">Accumulated Knowledge</a> are rotating out of Extended will likely be important there as well.</p>

<h2>Black:</h2>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dark%20Confidant&options=" data-card="Dark Confidant">Dark Confidant</a><br/>
This can be very dangerous and will kill you if you aren&rsquo;t careful but if you can use it without dying the effect is immensely powerful and its tacked onto an aggressive body as well.  This one may or may not wind up seeing a lot of play.  Even if it doesn&rsquo;t see much play expect it to be around $5 just by virtue of being a rare Invitational card.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hunted%20Horror&options=" data-card="Hunted Horror">Hunted Horror</a><br/>
The most dangerous of the Hunted creatures but with great reward.  That protection from black will likely make this one unplayable though as they can just use them as blockers and never take more than 1 damage from him.  A 7/7 Trample for two mana still looks cool though and this is at least better than <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Desecration%20Elemental&options=" data-card="Desecration Elemental">Desecration Elemental</a>.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Moonlight%20Bargain&options=" data-card="Moonlight Bargain">Moonlight Bargain</a><br/>
This is potentially amazing.  If you are willing to pay a bit of life it can draw cards like crazy or can just dig for something specific.  This is definitely something I&rsquo;d recommend getting ahold of.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Necroplasm&options=" data-card="Necroplasm">Necroplasm</a><br/>
I would be surprised if this doesn&rsquo;t see tournament play.  With the ability to wipe the board as well as recurse itself this is just amazing against aggro decks.  Just think of what this does to White Weenie.  It blow up all those <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Suntail%20Hawk&options=" data-card="Suntail Hawk">Suntail Hawks</a> then the <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Leonin%20Skyhunter&options=" data-card="Leonin Skyhunter">Leonin Skyhunters</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Samurai%20of%20the%20Pale%20Curtain&options=" data-card="Samurai of the Pale Curtain">Samurai of the Pale Curtain</a> next turn.</p>

<h2>Red:</h2>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Breath%20of%20Fury&options=" data-card="Breath of Fury">Breath of Fury</a><br/>
This is just a cool card.  Likely it will just make the opponent chump block the creature you throw this on but it still looks to be fun in casual play just for the thought of what it could do.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Char&options=" data-card="Char">Char</a><br/>
I remember when <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Psionic%20Blast&options=" data-card="Psionic Blast">this was blue</a>.  It took them 10 years to print it in the correct color.  The fact that it is rare really sucks but it is still quite solid even in a color that actually is supposed to get burn.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hunted%20Dragon&options=" data-card="Hunted Dragon">Hunted Dragon</a><br/>
This is likely the best of the Hunted cycle just because it has haste and its creatures can&rsquo;t block it.  The fact that you get the first swing makes it much easier to race.  You do get <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rorix&options=" data-card="Rorix">Rorix</a> for one more mana though and he just has one lower toughness.</p>

<h2>Green:</h2>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Carven%20Caryatid&options=" data-card="Carven Caryatid">Carven Caryatid</a><br/>
This isn&rsquo;t as good as <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wall%20of%20Blossoms&options=" data-card="Wall of Blossoms">Wall of Blossoms</a> but not being as good as the best wall ever printed isn&rsquo;t exactly the end of the world.  I fully expect this to see play as there is little that can get through its 5 toughness early on and being a cantrip makes it never a dead draw.  One problem with it is that <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Umezawa&rsquo;s%20Jitte&options=" data-card="Umezawa&amp;rsquo;s Jitte">Umezawa&rsquo;s Jitte</a> allows pretty much any creature to take it out in two turns.  We&rsquo;ll see how significant this is.  I expect this to be worth at least a dollar or two once it catches on so if you want some it is a good idea to get them early.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Chord%20of%20Calling&options=" data-card="Chord of Calling">Chord of Calling</a><br/>
Probably not worth it but you have to at least take a look at any of these types of card nowadays.  The fact that <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tooth%20and%20Nail&options=" data-card="Tooth and Nail">Tooth and Nail</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Natural%20Order&options=" data-card="Natural Order">Natural Order</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pattern%20of%20Rebirth&options=" data-card="Pattern of Rebirth">Pattern of Rebirth</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Skyshroud%20Poacher&options=" data-card="Skyshroud Poacher">Skyshroud Poacher</a>, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Defense%20of%20the%20Heart&options=" data-card="Defense of the Heart">Defense of the Heart</a> have all seen tournament play gives this mechanic a pretty good track record.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Elves%20of%20Deep%20Shadow&options=" data-card="Elves of Deep Shadow">Elves of Deep Shadow</a><br/>
A cool reprint.  Not terribly good especially with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Birds%20of%20Paradise&options=" data-card="Birds of Paradise">Birds of Paradise</a> in the same set but still a cool card.  Though admittedly the art was one of the things I liked about it before and I&rsquo;ve yet to seen the new art.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Farseek&options=" data-card="Farseek">Farseek</a><br/>
This is only notable because it finds the new dual lands.  Otherwise just a bad <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rampant%20Growth&options=" data-card="Rampant Growth">Rampant Growth</a>.  I don&rsquo;t expect it to see play.  One thing I want to point out is that it puts the lands into play tapped even if you pay the 2 life for the dual land so they are pretty much drawback free when you use this to tutor for them.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hunted%20Troll&options=" data-card="Hunted Troll">Hunted Troll</a><br/>
This is the easiest of the drawbacks on the Hunted creatures to deal with.  I have visions of using this with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Trophy%20Hunter&options=" data-card="Trophy Hunter">Trophy Hunter</a>.</p>

With <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Eternal%20Witness&options=" data-card="Eternal Witness">Eternal Witness</a> leaving I sort of expect this to see a bit of play.  It looses the broken part of Witness as it can&rsquo;t chump block, beat for 2, or be abused with bounce.  I think this is a balanced <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Regrowth&options=" data-card="Regrowth">Regrowth</a>.</p>

I really like this card.  It is a nice kick in the balls for <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Meloku%20the%20Clouded%20Mirror&options=" data-card="Meloku the Clouded Mirror">Meloku</a> and all the small white flyers around right now.</p>

<h2>Multicolor:</h2>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Autochthon%20Wurm&options=" data-card="Autochthon Wurm">Autochthon Wurm</a><br/>
This card is total ass.  I just wanted to point out there is a new card that is nice to flip with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Erratic%20Explosion&options=" data-card="Erratic Explosion">Erratic Explosion</a>, only one mana cheaper than <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Draco&options=" data-card="Draco">Draco</a>.  I fully expect one of these to make it into a reject rare draft.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bloodbond%20March&options=" data-card="Bloodbond March">Bloodbond March</a><br/>
There has to be some sort of fun combo with this card in casual play.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Circu,%20Dimir%20Lobotomist&options=" data-card="Circu, Dimir Lobotomist">Circu, Dimir Lobotomist</a><br/>
I also like this card.  This one also has the potential to be really good as well.  I would certainly use this in a deck designed to kill with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Quirion%20Dryad&options=" data-card="Quirion Dryad">Quirion Dryad</a> as those are generally made just to cast a bunch of black and blue cantrips every turn anyway which is also the best way to abuse this.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Psychatog&options=" data-card="Psychatog">Psychatog</a> also likes these decks.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dimir%20Cutpurse&options=" data-card="Dimir Cutpurse">Dimir Cutpurse</a><br/>
Wow, the <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ophidian&options=" data-card="Ophidian">Ophidian</a> replacements just keep getting better and better.  I&rsquo;ll more than likely be getting some of these.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dimir%20Doppelganger&options=" data-card="Dimir Doppelganger">Dimir Doppelganger</a><br/>
At least it is easier to understand than <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Volrath&rsquo;s%20Shapeshifter&options=" data-card="Volrath&amp;rsquo;s Shapeshifter">Volrath&rsquo;s Shapeshifter</a>.  It is another way to cheat <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Phage%20the%20Untouchable&options=" data-card="Phage the Untouchable">Phage</a> into play without dying.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Grave-Shell%20Scarab&options=" data-card="Grave-Shell Scarab">Grave-Shell Scarab</a><br/>
This is a pretty solid creature.  It has a solid body and provides a slow but steady source of small card advantage.  Sounds perfect for The Rock.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lightning%20Helix&options=" data-card="Lightning Helix">Lightning Helix</a><br/>
We haven&rsquo;t had an instant 2 mana for 3 damage burn spell for a long time.  If you happen to be playing the correct colors this card is amazing.  Too bad the color combination generally sucks.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mindleech%20Mass&options=" data-card="Mindleech Mass">Mindleech Mass</a><br/>
This looks like another fun reanimator target for causal play.  Playing your opponent&rsquo;s spells for free is likely fun.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Moroii&options=" data-card="Moroii">Moroii</a><br/>
Very solid aggressively costed beater.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised for this to see tournament play if the right deck for it pops up.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Putrefy&options=" data-card="Putrefy">Putrefy</a><br/>
With the exception of the new dual lands I think this is the best card in the set.  I recommend for every one of you to get 4 of these early as it will see play in almost every deck that can cast it.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Watchwolf&options=" data-card="Watchwolf">Watchwolf</a><br/>
I can&rsquo;t do it as much justice as <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/zm10" title="">Zvi did</a>) but the key thing to look at is the fact that it can at least trade with practically every creature that costs 4 or less mana (<a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Yukora&options=" data-card="Yukora">Yukora</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Iwamori&options=" data-card="Iwamori">Iwamori</a> excluded).  This can be a tremendous source of tempo.  There is a very good chance of a G/W beatdown deck in the the future.</p>

<h2>Guild Mana:</h2>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dimir%20Guildmage&options=" data-card="Dimir Guildmage">Dimir Guildmage</a><br/>
This didn&rsquo;t look exciting at first until I realized that a card that was just UU for a 2/2 that had 3U: Draw a card would be quite good for blue and this is essentially that with other abilities tacked on.  Just being a 2/2 2 drop in blue is enough to make this at least not suck.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gleancrawler&options=" data-card="Gleancrawler">Gleancrawler</a><br/>
There is a lot of combo potential here.</p>

<h2>Artifacts:</h2>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bottled%20Cloister&options=" data-card="Bottled Cloister">Bottled Cloister</a><br/>
Not exciting but at the very least is better than <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Grafted%20Skullcap&options=" data-card="Grafted Skullcap">Grafted Skullcap</a> and great with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ensnaring%20Bridge&options=" data-card="Ensnaring Bridge">Ensnaring Bridge</a>.  With the Bridge you have no hand during your opponent&rsquo;s turn and likely quite a few during your turn.  If that doesn&rsquo;t break the symmetry on the Bridge I don&rsquo;t know what does.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sunforger&options=" data-card="Sunforger">Sunforger</a><br/>
I can&rsquo;t quite figure out if this is good or not.  I&rsquo;d have to think more about potential targets.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Temple%20Garden&options=" data-card="Temple Garden">Temple Garden</a><br/>
Here are the biggest things to come out of the set.  These are the best dual lands since the fetchlands and go with them quite well.  I expect all of these to be worth $5-10 but still well worth it.  I plan on trying to get a set of these as well as the fetchlands over the next year.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>Ravnica is looking to be a pretty good set.  It is certainly more interesting than Kamigawa block.  There are plenty of cards for both the casual player and the tournament player and the block is laid out in a way we haven&rsquo;t seen before which keeps it interesting.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to the rest of the block which is more than I can say for any block since Invasion.</p>

<p>As far as which cards are likely to get expensive quickly there aren&rsquo;t too many at rare.  The new duals are of course amazing and will almost certainly be worth at least $8 with the commonly played colors to be closer to $10-12.  They might be a bit less since I doubt they will see much play in Vintage or Legacy since you can use real duals there.  So maybe they will be like the fetchlands and be worth $5 for the cheap ones and $10 for the expensive ones.  Whatever it is they will hold the price for a long time as they will be a staple of both Standard and Extended as long as they are legal.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dark%20Confidant&options=" data-card="Dark Confidant">Dark Confidant</a> will also be a bit pricey and if it doesn&rsquo;t break the environment (which I doubt it will) will likely settle around $5.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Necroplasm&options=" data-card="Necroplasm">Necroplasm</a> will likely be pretty expensive once it is discovered and I&rsquo;m guessing will start a bit cheaper so this might be one of the ones to grab early if you are interested in them.  If you want them better to get them for $3 or so than $5-6 if they see tournament play (which I expect it will).  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Moonlight%20Bargain&options=" data-card="Moonlight Bargain">Moonlight Bargain</a> is in the same boat but stands a smaller chance of becoming more expensive as it isn&rsquo;t as easy to see it being used.</p>

<p>If a deck pops up for it <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dimir%20Cutpurse&options=" data-card="Dimir Cutpurse">Dimir Cutpurse</a> might not be too cheap but will likely not start expensive so might be another that wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to grab early.</p>

<p>Even if it isn&rsquo;t used in standard <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Grave-Shell%20Scarab&options=" data-card="Grave-Shell Scarab">Grave-Shell Scarab</a> stands a decent chance of being played in Extended so consider it a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ravenous%20Baloth&options=" data-card="Ravenous Baloth">Ravenous Baloth</a> of sorts.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Circu,%20Dimir%20Lobotomist&options=" data-card="Circu, Dimir Lobotomist">Circu, Dimir Lobotomist</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sunforger&options=" data-card="Sunforger">Sunforger</a> might be $3-5 purely for casual play reasons.</p>

<p>As far as big uncommons go <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Putrefy&options=" data-card="Putrefy">Putrefy</a> is all but guaranteed to see play and is a likely candidate for chase Uncommon of the set.  If you were to go after only one card from Ravnica this would be a good choice. <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Watchwolf&options=" data-card="Watchwolf">Watchwolf</a> also is likely to be used heavily and is also very solid.  The only other Uncommons I see being worth a bit more than $1-2 would be <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Recollect&options=" data-card="Recollect">Recollect</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Telling%20Time&options=" data-card="Telling Time">Telling Time</a> but I doubt they will be too bad in price.</p>

<p>Even if they see very heavy play Commons are never worth anything while in print.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wild%20Mongrel&options=" data-card="Wild Mongrel">Wild Mongrel</a> was still a quarter when it was dominating multiple environments.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article will be about a few of the major magic sites out there.  I&rsquo;ll cover both past and present but will likely completely forget a few important ones because I either had never heard of them or because they just slipped my mind.</p>

<!--more-->


<h3>The Dojo:</h3>

<p>I may as well start with the original &ldquo;best&rdquo; Magic site.  This site basically invented the internet Magic community.  This brought both good and bad things to the game of Magic.  On the positive side it gave tournament players access to as much Magic information as they could possibly want and gave more casual players a look at competitive Magic.  On the negative side this also created the netdeck which many people consider the death of originality in magic.  It only takes one look at Tsuyoshi Fujita to realize originality is far from dead but playing a Tooth and Nail deck 5 cards away from a version that just won the latest Pro Tour in a casual environment is definitely not a nice thing to do.  The Dojo closed down years ago but you can find some archives <a href="http://www.classicdojo.org/">here</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000510222037/www.thedojo.com/">here</a> (reading articles about how the new 6th Edition rules will kill Magic is some quality entertainment btw).</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/welcome.asp">magicthegathering.com:</a></h3>

<p>The only official Magic site and also the one with the most traffic (StarCity is second).  Easily the best place for casual magic (especially the boards) and now has pretty good competitive articles as well (mostly due to Flores and Zvi).  This also provides something you can&rsquo;t get anywhere else and that is that since it is an official site half the writers are actual Wizards employees.  This means you get a closer look at what goes on inside the company and also most news is released here first (unless it gets leaked early in which case mtgsalvation usually prints it first).</p>

<h3>The Sideboard:</h3>

<p>This was the official Wizards tournament Magic site.  It had an occasional drafting or constructed article but was really known for being the official place for tournament coverage.  It has since merged with magicthegathering.com as Wizards decided there was no reason to keep the sites separate.  If you dig around in the archives in the <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/tournamentcenter">tournament center</a> most of the older coverage is from the sideboard.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.mtgnews.com/">MTG News:</a></h3>

<p>Just a year or two ago this was the number one place for Magic related news.  They were always the first place to have full spoilers and had very active message boards.  It also had the first decent spoiler generator that let you search with many different filters.  Eventually the boards declined to the point where every news post no matter how minor fueled dozens of people to declare the news to be &ldquo;the death of Magic.&rdquo;  This was understandable behavior in large things like the 6th Edition rules changes or new card face in 8th but they would have that reaction to literally everything.  Removing <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Winter%20Orb&options=" data-card="Winter Orb">Winter Orb</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Stasis&options=" data-card="Stasis">Stasis</a> from the base set? Magic is now dead.  Deciding Banding is too confusing to keep in print?  Magic is dead again.  Eventually the site stopped being the first to report news and eventually just started reporting things said on other sites a day or two later.  It became <strike>the number one</strike> an almost bearable place for old Magic news.  For a clue to how dead it is the last update was on Aug 3 and it was updated a total of 3 times in July.  Even the spoiler generator is broken now.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.mtgsalvation.com/">MTG Salvation:</a></h3>

<p>This site has pretty much taken over for the now dead mtgnews.com.  It is now generally the first place to have full spoilers and has pretty active message boards.  I really don&rsquo;t visit it for anything beyond early spoilers though.</p>

<h3><a href="http://magic.tcgplayer.com/">Brainburst:</a></h3>

<p>Once upon a time a bit after the Dojo closed this became the best place for competitive magic information.  This is where I first started reading about tournament magic.  The articles were very high quality and informative.  They had all the big names such as Zvi and Kai.  They eventually started a premium service which helped them afford even more quality writers.  Eventually though the quality started slipping.  The articles kept getting worse and worse and many of their big name writers started leaving.  The site is now practically a joke.  They have like one quality article a month on the free side.  I&rsquo;m not sure how the premium side is but I&rsquo;ve heard it isn&rsquo;t much better.  To give you a clue of how bad it is earlier this week there was <a href="http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=5591">an article about building a R/W beatdown deck.</a>  The deck was one of the worst decks I&rsquo;ve ever seen on a tournament magic site.  It had three copies of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblin%20Piker&options=" data-card="Goblin Piker">Goblin Piker</a> in the deck but had <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hearth%20Kami&options=" data-card="Hearth Kami">Hearth Kami</a> in the sideboard.  It also had 2 copies of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Warrior&rsquo;s%20Honor&options=" data-card="Warrior&amp;rsquo;s Honor">Warrior&rsquo;s Honor</a> in the deck but no <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Roar%20of%20the%20Kha&options=" data-card="Roar of the Kha">Roar of the Kha</a>, maindecked <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Reverse%20Damage&options=" data-card="Reverse Damage">Reverse Damage</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Path%20of%20Anger&rsquo;s%20Flame&options=" data-card="Path of Anger&amp;rsquo;s Flame">Path of Anger&rsquo;s Flame</a>, and running multiple copies of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Flamewave&options=" data-card="Flamewave">Flamewave</a> in a deck with no mana fixing.  Also it was a post 9th Standard decklist with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boil&options=" data-card="Boil">Boil</a> in the sideboard and thus isn&rsquo;t even legal.  That said I usually at least take a glimpse at the site each day as there are occasionally good articles.  They are just quite rare.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.starcitygames.com/magic.php">StarCityGames:</a></h3>

<p>This is the current leading site for competitive magic and probably second for casual magic (after the official site).  The articles are often very high quality.  As soon as I saw that Jamie Wakefield was a premium writer I signed up for three months of the premium mostly just to see if it was worth it.  Turns out it was and when my subscription ran out I signed up for another year.  There are generally at least 2-3 amazing articles a week and even the others are often entertaining and/or informative.  Even the free side has plenty of quality articles.  Also this site in number one in terms of just the quantity of articles printed.  Most magic sites print 2 articles a day.  StarCity prints around 4-6 counting both premium and non-premium.  Also since the premium service popped up the prices of their online store have been getting much better.  While everything used to be hugely overpriced a lot of it is much more competitively priced.  There are many cards that are even comparable with cardshark now.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.themanadrain.com/">The Mana Drain:</a></h3>

<p>This is a Vintage focused message board community.  I rarely if ever read anything on here and use StarCity as my source of Vintage information but most of the major Vintage names hang out on these boards and if you wanted to give Vintage a serious try this would be a good place to start.  There are also more casual sections of the boards that generally contain the crappy Vintage decks but if you want casual boards magicthegathering.com is a much better place.</p>

<h3><a href="http://mtgthesource.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi">The Source:</a></h3>

<p>This is supposedly the number one place for Type 1.5/Legacy information.  Not that that means a whole lot at the current moment but with Gencon coming up (which contains the Legacy world championship) in a week or two as well as the fact that Wizards is officially supporting the format next season (at least on a trial basis) means this will become more important later.</p>

<p>There are certainly plenty of other magic sites out there but these are the ones that provide(d) the best information.  I read everything magicthegathering.com and StarCity and skim articles on Brainburst daily.  I&rsquo;ll look at new spoilers on MTG Salvation but generally don&rsquo;t pay attention to articles or the rumor mills.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Its story time.  In this article I&rsquo;m going to go over my history as a magic player/deck builder and some of the most important decks I&rsquo;ve built.  I&rsquo;ll also include the times I think I did the most improvement over and maybe a few reasons why.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Beginning and My First Deck</h2>

<p>This is the most obvious starting point and a very important one at that.  If there wasn&rsquo;t a first deck there wouldn&rsquo;t be any other decks either.</p>

<p>My first exposure to Magic was in 7th grade where I watched a game two people in my group in Home Economics class were playing.  I wasn&rsquo;t all that interested at the time but it was the first time I has seen a Magic card.  I do remember that one of the players was Shane Grimes (I didn&rsquo;t know him yet at that point though) and that there was a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Feral%20Thallid&options=" data-card="Feral Thallid">Feral Thallid</a> in play at some point.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t see it again for a while though and it wasn&rsquo;t until I became friends with Dustin that I actually became interested in the game.  He didn&rsquo;t actually teach me how to play though.  I was self taught.  After watching him play for a while I became interested and downloaded the demo for the Micropose Magic game.  This demo basically just let you duel an opponent with one of 5 decks (one of each color).  The first thing I did even before installing the demo was print out the rules and read them.  This is something that is totally like me and not something that most people would do.  I learned to play Magic by basically reading the <a href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/comprules/MagicCompRules050201.txt">the Comprehensive Rules</a>.  I didn&rsquo;t play a game with a friend and have them introduce me to it slowly.  I read a 150 page text file.  Try finding more people who learned like that.  After a few weeks of playing the demo Dustin took me to a local card shop to get my first real cards.</p>

<p>It was March of 1997.  Fifth Edition was the newest set (as in like a week or two old) and Mirage was the most recent Expansion.  I had been watching Dustin play for a while and he took me to a local card shop to get my first cards.  I had around $20 to spend for the first month and likely about $5 each week after that.  Funds were tight.  My only income was a $20 a month allowance and if I skipped lunch $10 a week.  I usually spend half the lunch money on food and pocketed the rest (I kept this tradition up throughout High School).  At the time Dustin was assembling a set of 5th Edition (He eventually took this apart because 5th is gay) which influenced the cards he told me to buy.  I bought a Starter of Mirage and 2-3 boosters of 5th Edition.  I don&rsquo;t remember all of the rares I got but I do know among them was a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Soul%20Echo&options=" data-card="Soul Echo">Soul Echo</a> and a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sylvan%20Library&options=" data-card="Sylvan Library">Sylvan Library</a>.  I still have that <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Soul%20Echo&options=" data-card="Soul Echo">Soul Echo</a>.  Dustin took a look at the cards and decided black and green were my best colors.  We then went to Dustin&rsquo;s and he traded something like 200-300 spare black and green commons and a bunch of basic lands for the Sylvan Library and possibly a few other cards I don&rsquo;t remember.  He then assembled a black/green deck out of those cards.  The only cards I remember being in the deck were <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Erg%20Raiders&options=" data-card="Erg Raiders">Erg Raiders</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Scryb%20Sprites&options=" data-card="Scryb Sprites">Scryb Sprites</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ironroot%20Treefolk&options=" data-card="Ironroot Treefolk">Ironroot Treefolk</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gravebane%20Zombie&options=" data-card="Gravebane Zombie">Gravebane Zombie</a>, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Word%20of%20Binding&options=" data-card="Word of Binding">Word of Binding</a>.  We didn&rsquo;t have time to actually play a game and I went home having still never played an actual game of Magic.</p>

<p>Of course the first thing I did when I got home was add like 20 cards I thought were cool to the deck and didn&rsquo;t add any more land to offset this.  Go noobs.  I do remember that I removed <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Word%20of%20Binding&options=" data-card="Word of Binding">Word of Binding</a> because I thought it sucked and added <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hasran%20Ogress&options=" data-card="Hasran Ogress">Hasran Ogress</a> because she was cool.  At least I got that part right (meaning <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Word%20of%20Binding&options=" data-card="Word of Binding">Word of Binding</a> does in fact suck and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hasran%20Ogress&options=" data-card="Hasran Ogress">Hasran Ogress</a> is still cool).  I don&rsquo;t remember the exact deck but I&rsquo;m sure it was over 80 cards with 24 land.</p>

<p>My first attempt at an actual game of Magic was during Spanish class with a guy named Matt Hoffman.  He used to follow Dustin around and was present when I bought my cards.  I want to first say that Matt Hoffman is a huge dick.  This game will be my biggest example of why.  I don&rsquo;t remember too much except that he completely destroyed me.  I only later found out why.  He cheated.  Big time.  He basically took advantage of the fact that I was new and made up rules and told me cards did things that they didn&rsquo;t actually do.  I remember at one point I had out <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gravebane%20Zombie&options=" data-card="Gravebane Zombie">Gravebane Zombie</a> (this was totally my favorite card) and during his turn he tapped a red creature and said it &ldquo;forced him to attack and he couldn&rsquo;t so he was dead.&rdquo;  I picked up the zombie and put it on top of my library.  He told me &ldquo;No, it is removed from the game and couldn&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;  I remembered what the art on the card looked like and eventually learned what the card was.  So what card was it that can do all this?  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dwarven%20Warriors&options=" data-card="Dwarven Warriors">Dwarven Warriors</a>.  He cheated against someone playing their absolute first real game of magic ever. Needless to say Matt Hoffman is a huge dick.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember much else I did with this deck but I do know I never won a single game with it.  I eventually dismantled it and built a mono-black deck.  This deck was pretty similar but ran none of the lame green cards and more cool black cards.  It was still likely over 80 cards though.  Again, go noobs.  I don&rsquo;t remember too much about this deck except that it was what I used to win my first game.  I remember I killed Dustin with a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gravebane%20Zombie&options=" data-card="Gravebane Zombie">Gravebane Zombie</a> enchanted with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Unholy%20Strength&options=" data-card="Unholy Strength">Unholy Strength</a>.  I want to point out that I had been playing for about a month at this point and had made a few trips to the local card shop and raided the $0.10 common bin a few times.  I had played for a month before I won my first game.  So much for Dustin taking it easy on a noob.</p>

<p>The next magic memory I have is at the mall with Dustin.  Visions and Weatherlight packs are on sale and I bought a few.  I pulled a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mana%20Web&options=" data-card="Mana Web">Mana Web</a> and an <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Archangel&options=" data-card="Archangel">Archangel</a>.  I still have both cards (the angel is even in a deck right now).  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mana%20Web&options=" data-card="Mana Web">Mana Web</a> will become important later on as well.</p>

<h2>The missing card days</h2>

<p>The next year I was playing magic more often.  I played during lunch, during Spanish class with Dustin, and in the Games Club after school.  These times were probably when I was playing the most magic.  My collection still sucked because I hadn&rsquo;t bought any cards online yet and the local card shop had closed so I wasn&rsquo;t buying any singles.  I was basically just buying 2-3 boosters a week of the newest expansion (Tempest block at this time). Because of this my decks still sucked and I still didn&rsquo;t win much.  But at least the games were closer than they used to be.</p>

<p>It was also around this time that I made my first deck that actually had a decent shot of winning without just getting really lucky.  It was a mono-black deck with all my best black cards.  It had a massive amount of recursion including <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gravebane%20Zombies&options=" data-card="Gravebane Zombies">Gravebane Zombies</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Disturbed%20Burials&options=" data-card="Disturbed Burials">Disturbed Burials</a>, a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Volrath&rsquo;s%20Stronghold&options=" data-card="Volrath&amp;rsquo;s Stronghold">Volrath&rsquo;s Stronghold</a>, and a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mortuary&options=" data-card="Mortuary">Mortuary</a>.  The creatures still weren&rsquo;t all that great but I think I had a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sengir%20Vampire&options=" data-card="Sengir Vampire">Sengir Vampire</a> or two and some other semi-decent creatures like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jun%C3%BAn%20Efreet&options=" data-card="Junún Efreet">Junún Efreet</a>.  Really the deck was only even semi-decent because <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Disturbed%20Burial&options=" data-card="Disturbed Burial">Disturbed Burial</a> was tech.  The deck was 83 cards though so I can&rsquo;t be too proud of it.  Note that I had been playing almost a year and I still couldn&rsquo;t seem to keep a deck to 60 cards.  At least this time added extra land to make up for it.</p>

<p>This is also the time period when something bad happened.  My brother took all my cards not in a deck.  Well almost all of them.  He left the white bordered blue and white cards and all of my Tempest and Stronghold.  My mom didn&rsquo;t know I was playing yet and I wasn&rsquo;t sure she would approve so I didn&rsquo;t tell her right away.  My brother of course denied it but that said nothing.  Many times I would ask him if he had taken something of mine and he would get angry yell and scream and say he never touched it.  I would then find it in his backpack.  Even when caught he would still deny everything.  He had the same reaction when he was innocent as well so it just seemed he was always guilty.  Well back to the missing cards there wasn&rsquo;t really anything valuable except one <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Regrowth&options=" data-card="Regrowth">Regrowth</a> which isn&rsquo;t even that valuable money-wise but it still put a large damper on deckbuilding.  During these times I had to make due with what I had.  I was doing much <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rootwalla&options=" data-card="Rootwalla">Rootwalla</a> beatdown and also playing a lot more white and blue since more of those colors were left. Still not too much though so the decks really sucked.  Eventually to help out Dustin gave me a large stack of his black extras.  Most of these were crappy commons but it was still better than nothing.  At this point more than 75% of my collection was black cards.  I was playing a lot of black during these times.  Actually I had really been playing black since I started.  I played the other colors every once in a while but not very often.  A few months later my mom found my cards in her closet behind all of her shoes.  A few cards were still missing but enough of my collection was back that I could build decent decks again.  Well decent for me at the time anyway.</p>

<p>This is also the time I built my first synergetic decks.  The first was based around <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Contemplation&options=" data-card="Contemplation">Contemplation</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shrieking%20Drake&options=" data-card="Shrieking Drake">Shrieking Drake</a>.  That combo basically lets you gain life equal to the amount of blue mana you have.  In the process of making this deck I discovered <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Intruder%20Alarm&options=" data-card="Intruder Alarm">Intruder Alarm</a>.  With <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shrieking%20Drake&options=" data-card="Shrieking Drake">Shrieking Drake</a> you can pay a blue mana to untap all of your creatures.  I added <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rootwater%20Hunter&options=" data-card="Rootwater Hunter">Tims</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Quirion%20Elves&options=" data-card="Quirion Elves">Mana Elves</a> to produce the necessary mana so the deck could go infinite.  I also discovered <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Aluren&options=" data-card="Aluren">Aluren</a> later during the same day which allowed the deck to go infinite at instant speed and without any mana.  After the deck was finished (I proxied the cards I didn&rsquo;t have) it was able to generate infinite mana, infinite damage, infinite creatures (via <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lab%20Rats&options=" data-card="Lab Rats">Lab Rats</a>), and gain infinite life.  With infinite mana pretty much any spell with buyback can go infinite but the only ones I really remember using were <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lab%20Rats&options=" data-card="Lab Rats">Lab Rats</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Capsize&options=" data-card="Capsize">Capsize</a>.  This was my first true combo deck and I came up with it at least a week or two before <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Intruder%20Alarm&options=" data-card="Intruder Alarm">Intruder Alarm</a> combos started popping up in the internet.  The deck was slow and extremely fragile but when it won it won big.</p>

<p>At this point was also when I started buying cards off ebay.  I bought a bunch of Exodus cards as well as a few <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shivan%20Dragon&options=" data-card="Shivan Dragon">Shivan Dragons</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Nightmare&options=" data-card="Nightmare">Nightmares</a>, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Royal%20Assassin&options=" data-card="Royal Assassin">Royal Assassins</a>.  At the time I had to use my parents ebay account so I couldn&rsquo;t spend much plus it was a bit of a hassle to get money orders for payment.</p>

<h2>Mana Web and Urza&rsquo;s Saga</h2>

<p>I think the first time I started to really get better at the game was when Urza&rsquo;s Saga came out.  I bought a lot of Urza&rsquo;s Saga.  More than any set that I have bought to date.  Urza&rsquo;s Saga happened to have a lot of broken cards in it.  I happened to pull some of them.  This combined with trading with Dustin (who also bought a lot of Urza&rsquo;s Saga) meant I had even more good Urza&rsquo;s Saga.  About once a month the Games Club would have a Magic tournament.  The format varied a lot and was often something wacky.  The first one I went to was a chaos multiplayer game.  I got third (only out of like 6 so it wasn&rsquo;t to exciting) and ended up winning my first <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Royal%20Assassin&options=" data-card="Royal Assassin">Royal Assassin</a>.  I won a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bayou&options=" data-card="Bayou">Bayou</a> in another multiplayer game as well (which I eventually lost) and also a pack of red sleeves.  I still have the sleeves.  My Really Big Red multiplayer deck is in them right now.</p>

<p>Another tournament was Urza&rsquo;s block constructed (which just consisted of Urza&rsquo;s Saga at this point).  I built a red/green aggro deck with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Endless%20Wurm&options=" data-card="Endless Wurm">Endless Wurms</a> that stayed around because of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rancor&options=" data-card="Rancor">Rancor</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fortitude&options=" data-card="Fortitude">Fortitude</a>, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fiery%20Mantle&options=" data-card="Fiery Mantle">Fiery Mantle</a>.  The deck also had <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Child%20of%20Gaea&options=" data-card="Child of Gaea">Child of Gaea</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cradle%20Guard&options=" data-card="Cradle Guard">Cradle Guard</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Viashino%20Outrider&options=" data-card="Viashino Outrider">Viashino Outrider</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vug%20Lizard&options=" data-card="Vug Lizard">Vug Lizard</a>, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Winding%20Wurm&options=" data-card="Winding Wurm">Winding Wurm</a> to round out the creature base.  These creatures were very large for their cost and could be a beating.  I used <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Arc%20Lightning&options=" data-card="Arc Lightning">Arc Lightning</a> for removal.  I ended up winning the tournament.  The prize was a free entry into a large tournament at Neutral Ground (<a href="http://www.wizards.com/sideboard/article.asp?x=results/GPSF99">Grand Prix San Francisco 1999</a>).  I went to the tournament.  I had never even heard of limited before.  I opened amazing packs (<a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shivan%20Hellkite&options=" data-card="Shivan Hellkite">Shivan Hellkite</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Stroke%20of%20Genius&options=" data-card="Stroke of Genius">Stroke of Genius</a>) and built a crappy deck with them (it was 45 cards and had a lot of good limited cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pendrell%20Drake&options=" data-card="Pendrell Drake">Pendrell Drake</a> in the sideboard).  I didn&rsquo;t do so well but had a lot of fun (and went home with some broken rares).  One lesson to learn from this is that if you ever imagine you would care about your DCI rating don&rsquo;t let your first tournament be a 40k event.  My limited rating dropped like 40 points that day and I still haven&rsquo;t gotten them back (not that I have really tried).  Also I didn&rsquo;t know at the time but my round 4 loss was to <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/authorarchive&amp;author=ChadEllis">Chad Ellis</a>.</p>

<p>My next big deck idea was inspired by a Weatherlight card I had pulled, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mana%20Web&options=" data-card="Mana Web">Mana Web</a>.  My idea was to combine it with as many cards that force your opponent to pay mana as possible.  The first version of the deck was mostly proxies and was also quite terrible.  It ran cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lim-Dul&rsquo;s%20Hex&options=" data-card="Lim-Dul&amp;rsquo;s Hex">Lim-Dûl’s Hex</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Seizures&options=" data-card="Seizures">Seizures</a>, both proxied.  I even had to proxy <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Psychic%20Venom&options=" data-card="Psychic Venom">Psychic Venom</a>.  The deck was pretty bad at this point but with a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Psychic%20Venom&options=" data-card="Psychic Venom">Psychic Venom</a> on an opponent&rsquo;s land <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mana%20Web&options=" data-card="Mana Web">Mana Web</a> + <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lim-Dul&rsquo;s%20Hex&options=" data-card="Lim-Dul&amp;rsquo;s Hex">Lim-Dûl&rsquo;s Hex</a> meant that the opponent was not likely to avoid damage.  The deck didn&rsquo;t start to get better until Urza&rsquo;s Saga was released with a bunch of cards that helped the deck considerably.  The biggest two were <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Slow%20Motion&options=" data-card="Slow Motion">Slow Motion</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Disruptive%20Student&options=" data-card="Disruptive Student">Disruptive Student</a>.

There were many versions of the deck and I was always experimenting but what I consider to be the classic version looked something like this:</p>

<h2>The break and rebirth</h2>

<p>Later that year Dustin graduated.  This pretty much ended my playing Magic at school.  I didn&rsquo;t see much at all of Dustin during that year and pretty much only had contact with him through AIM.  I wasn&rsquo;t really missing that much magic-wise though.  This was the year of Masques block (and the tail end of Urza&rsquo;s,  I didn&rsquo;t buy much Destiny).  While the lack of anyone to play with was the reason I didn&rsquo;t play the boring set certainly didn&rsquo;t help.  During this time period, while I didn&rsquo;t play any magic, was when I started reading about tournament magic.  This was my first taste of magic strategy.</p>

<p>The point I started back up again was when Invasion came out but I don&rsquo;t think the set really was the reason.  The real reason was that Dustin came back and I actually had someone to play with.  During that time our magic group met at Coffee Cavern of Friday night and played for a few hours.  We had an Invasion league going which we added packs to when other sets came out.  I started buying cards again and putting together more decks.  I think this is the point where I started to close the gap between Dustin and I play skill-wise.  He was still better than me but not by as much.  My only decent decks were still <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mana%20Web&options=" data-card="Mana Web">Mana Web</a> and mono-black aggro-control decks (we always called them Stupid Black decks).  For the most part my decks were still a bunch of cards I thought were good and only a few followed a theme that helped the deck stay focused.</p>

<p>Invasion block was also my first experience with drafting.  I had played sealed a few times but didn&rsquo;t draft until one of Sam&rsquo;s birthdays.  It was an IPA draft and the easiest way I could help people remember the specific draft would be to say &ldquo;<a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fungal%20Shambler&options=" data-card="Fungal Shambler">Fungal Shambler</a>!?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After we stopped playing on Friday nights I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to really play with anyone but Dustin.  Kim&rsquo;s cards were &ldquo;in the closet&rdquo; at the time and it took her like 6 months to dig them out.  We could occasionally grab a couple extra people for a draft but it was only on a rare occasion.  While we still played magic it wasn&rsquo;t all that often and I didn&rsquo;t really buy many cards during this time period (this was during mid-late Oddessy block and very early Onslaught).</p>

<p>Magic Online came out around this time in beta.  In testing the beta you were given a certain amount of money you could spend a the store each day (something like $50-100, they tweaked the number often).  You spend that however you wanted on packs/tickets or anything.  Basically this meant both being able to get a complete Magic Online collection after about a week and also being able to draft for free.  I did a lot of drafting online during these times though since it was free and I didn&rsquo;t need the cards I often dropped when I got bored rather than stay for the entire draft.  This usually meant I dropped after round one regardless of whether I won or lost.  With an entire set of type 2 legal cards at my disposal I was also able to do a lot of experimenting with deckbuilding without the limitation of a crappy collection.  I started building many stupid decks (I&rsquo;m still fond of my <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Familiar%20Ground&options=" data-card="Familiar Ground">Familiar Ground</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblin%20War%20Drums&options=" data-card="Goblin War Drums">Goblin War Drums</a> deck) but eventually I began to try experimenting with more powerful decks.  One in particular was Mono Black Control.  It was a creatureless control deck with an enormous amount of creature removal and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Corrupt&options=" data-card="Corrupt">Corrupt</a> as the win condition.  With <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cabal%20Coffers&options=" data-card="Cabal Coffers">Cabal Coffers</a> you could power expensive spells like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Planar%20Portal&options=" data-card="Planar Portal">Planar Portal</a>.  It felt a bit like the old Necro decks.  Eventually I looked at the decks the pro players were playing and found that this was very similar to the builds they were using.  This prompted me to try building other tournament decks to see what it feels like to play with them.  I still was quite bad (my <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Psychatog&options=" data-card="Psychatog">Psychatog</a> deck didn&rsquo;t run <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Psychatog&options=" data-card="Psychatog">Psychatog</a> and instead just tried to do 20 damage with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thieving%20Magpie&options=" data-card="Thieving Magpie">Thieving Magpie</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shadowmage%20Infiltrator&options=" data-card="Shadowmage Infiltrator">Shadowmage Infiltrator</a>).  I never really ended up with anything good and was always getting smashed in the serious players room but I learned a lot about deckbuilding and eventually applied it to my real cards.</p>

<p>Until this point my decks were usually just a collection of creatures and spells that were good/cool.  Only a few of my decks had real themes to them (like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mana%20Web&options=" data-card="Mana Web">Mana Web</a>) and many of the decks were just plain bad.  After messing with the Magic Online beta I began to get a better feel for deckbuilding and decided to take a whack at building a Mono Black Control deck in real life.  It started simple enough <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Duress&options=" data-card="Duress">Duress</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hymn%20to%20Tourach&options=" data-card="Hymn to Tourach">Hymn to Tourach</a> for discard, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Nevinyrral&rsquo;s%20Disk&options=" data-card="Nevinyrral&amp;rsquo;s Disk">Nevinyrral&rsquo;s Disk</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Diabolic%20Edict&options=" data-card="Diabolic Edict">Diabolic Edict</a> for creature control, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Necropotence&options=" data-card="Necropotence">Necropotence</a> for the draw engine, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Drain%20Life&options=" data-card="Drain Life">Drain Life</a> for the win condition.  Over the next few months I worked almost exclusively on this deck.  I bought more cards for it like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mutilate&options=" data-card="Mutilate">Mutilate</a> and tuned it and made it very powerful.  In fact too powerful.  This deck absolutely dominated the environment.  I had it put together long enough to play like 100 games with it.  Out of those 100+ games I lost maybe 6.  In our environment this deck was just unstoppable.  To make matters worse we also ignored the restrictions on <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Necropotence&options=" data-card="Necropotence">Necropotence</a> and ran multiple copies in the deck (because it is a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; card).  Dustin had also build one and played his quite often to.  Eventually we almost just stopped playing other decks because they just couldn&rsquo;t beat this one.  Eventually we both realized this and stopped playing MBC for the sake of our enjoyment of the game.  We both played it one more time each in type 3 but haven&rsquo;t tried it casually since.  Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll throw the deck together just to show you guys how scary it is (or at least write an article about it).  Just for reference it looked like this:</p>

<p>This is also about the time I started perusing the casual forums on the magicthegathering.com message boards.  I helped people with their decks and thus saw a lot of decks both good and bad and went through the process of tweaking them to be more efficient.  This helping others with their decks has had a huge impact on my own deckbuilding.  My decks became more consistent and powerful.</p>

<p>The next change came about when we actually began to have something you could actually call a group again.  Kim finally got her cards out of her closet, BJ was around more often, and Branden had popped up and began to play.</p>

<h2>Type 3 and Modern Times:</h2>

<p>This is when we began playing type 3.  I don&rsquo;t have to go into much detail here because by this point you were all around.  Really the thing I got to practice in type 3 that I didn&rsquo;t elsewhere was metagaming and sideboarding.  We don&rsquo;t use sideboards in casual games (though some groups do) so this was something I didn&rsquo;t really know how to do.  Unfortunately since our environment was completely different each week I never got the hang of it anyway.</p>

<p>That brings us to present day and the end of the article.  It wound up much longer than I expected.</p>

I&rsquo;ve tried to use it and it always seemed pretty crappy.</p>

<p>As such I decided to do some research on the decks that use it and how it is done.

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>Every deck I found that ran <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Deep%20Analysis&options=" data-card="Deep Analysis">Deep Analysis</a> also had multiple ways of getting it into the graveyard without paying the four mana. This means you can&rsquo;t look at it like a crappy <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Inspiration&options=" data-card="Inspiration">Inspiration</a> then flashing it back. Instead you need to look at it as <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Night&rsquo;s%20Whisper&options=" data-card="Night&amp;rsquo;s Whisper">Night&rsquo;s Whisper</a> for one more life. The fact that blue is a much better control color than black makes this worth one more life.</p>

<p>This is the point I had previously missed when trying to use it myself. I&rsquo;ve always just cast it then flashed it back later. I knew the U/G Madness players could discard it but I didn&rsquo;t expect every deck that ran it to do so. Maybe I&rsquo;ll have to give it another shot using it correctly. The only deck with less than 10 ways to get it into the graveyard also happens to be the deck with a huge mana engine that can tap 2 lands to cast it in the first place.</p>

<p>Another important point I should make is that <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Deep%20Analysis&options=" data-card="Deep Analysis">Deep Analysis</a> is great against discard. Normally resolving something like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mind%20Sludge&options=" data-card="Mind Sludge">Mind Sludge</a> or <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Persecute&options=" data-card="Persecute">Persecute</a> against a control deck is game over but if that discard spell also dumps 1-2 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Deep%20Analysis&options=" data-card="Deep Analysis">Deep Analysis</a> in the graveyard that hand just magically comes back if not even grows. Since <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Deep%20Analysis&options=" data-card="Deep Analysis">Deep Analysis</a> is in Torment, the set of MBC, this is quite significant.</p>

<p>The last point that is kinda neat about <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Deep%20Analysis&options=" data-card="Deep Analysis">Deep Analysis</a> is that since many magic players are lazy and shorten practically every card name they tend to call it Deep Anal which will always make me and my 7-year-old sense of humor giggle. How could you not enjoy saying &ldquo;Flash my Deep Anal?&rdquo;</p>
