    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to talk about aggro decks for a while now but could never decide on which one. After Branden&rsquo;s request of discussing the Stompy deck I ran in Type 3 I figured this is a good a choice as any.</p>

<p>There are essentially two ways to design and play an aggro deck without turning it into an aggro-control deck. The first is the all out weenie approach. You find the most aggressive creatures possible with the smallest mana curve possible. When playing the deck you go for the swarm and kill method. For an example of this strategy we are all very familiar with look at BJ&rsquo;s Elf deck. If left unchecked he can easily amass a very large army of elves and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Overrun&options=" data-card="Overrun">Overrun</a> for the win by turn 5. The major weakness of this type of deck is that you are often one well-timed <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pyroclasm&options=" data-card="Pyroclasm">Pyroclasm</a> away from defeat. If they turn your army of small dudes into 1-3 little dudes going in for the kill becomes more difficult. Examples of creatures you find in this type of deck include any good creature that costs 1-2 mana and has at least two power, one-drops especially (<a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Savannah%20Lions&options=" data-card="Savannah Lions">Savannah Lions</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jackal%20Pup&options=" data-card="Jackal Pup">Jackal Pup</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jungle%20Lion&options=" data-card="Jungle Lion">Jungle Lion</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Carnophage&options=" data-card="Carnophage">Carnophage</a>).</p>

<p>The second type of aggro is a little more conservative. It basically just always wants a threat on the table. You can drop a few creatures that are better than what is on the board at the time and just attack with them until they are dealt with. You then drop a few more. This method is a bit slower but wont scoop to <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wrath%20of%20God&options=" data-card="Wrath of God">Wrath of God</a>. Also creatures that cost 3-4 mana are more common than in the weenie builds. Examples of creatures found in this type of deck include <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Troll%20Ascetic&options=" data-card="Troll Ascetic">Troll Ascetic</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Blastoderm&options=" data-card="Blastoderm">Blastoderm</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Arc-Slogger&options=" data-card="Arc-Slogger">Arc-Slogger</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hypnotic%20Specter&options=" data-card="Hypnotic Specter">Hypnotic Specter</a>, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Nantuko%20Shade&options=" data-card="Nantuko Shade">Nantuko Shade</a>. These type of decks can be aggro control decks like Fish or Sligh (the original Sligh not the weenie deck people call Sligh now which is actually Deadguy Red) but don&rsquo;t have to be. An example of a non aggro-control aggro deck of this type would be <a href="http://www.germagic.de/nda/deck.php?id=1062">Fires</a>.</p>

<p>Today we are going to focus on the first type of aggro, the weenie deck.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to take a look at my Type 3 Stompy deck and explain each of the card choices and some of the cards that were in earlier versions but eventually got cut as well as cards that might be in the deck if I owned any.</p>

</div></div></p>

<p>Before I get to the individual card analysis I want to take a more broad look at the deck as a whole. First I&rsquo;ll talk about the mana.</p>

<p>While there are only 12 actual lands in the deck it has 24 cards that can get you mana. The deck never really needs more than two land in play and can function very well on one land if you draw <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Quirion%20Ranger&options=" data-card="Quirion Ranger">Quirion Ranger</a>. Also in this deck <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Land%20Grant&options=" data-card="Land Grant">Land Grant</a> 9 times out of 10 is just as good as a land and often even better since it can thin your deck a bit. <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lotus%20Petal&options=" data-card="Lotus Petal">Lotus Petal</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Elvish%20Spirit%20Guide&options=" data-card="Elvish Spirit Guide">Elvish Spirit Guide</a> are essentially other one-time use lands that can give you a very explosive start and let you dump your hand very quickly.</p>

<h2>Mana:</h2>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Forest&options=" data-card="Forest">Forest</a><br/>
I don&rsquo;t think an explanation is necessary here.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gaea&rsquo;s%20Cradle&options=" data-card="Gaea&amp;rsquo;s Cradle">Gaea&rsquo;s Cradle</a><br/>
I have one and it can lead to some explosive starts on occasion. I do want to mention that it can be a liability if it is your only way to produce mana in your opening hand. Also it can&rsquo;t be sacked to <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plant%20Elemental&options=" data-card="Plant Elemental">Plant Elemental</a> or <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rogue%20Elephant&options=" data-card="Rogue Elephant">Rogue Elephant</a></p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Land%20Grant&options=" data-card="Land Grant">Land Grant</a><br/>
Basically <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Forest&options=" data-card="Forest">Forest</a> #12-14. It also helps thin your deck so you don&rsquo;t draw land later and can be used to pay the alternate casting cost on <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bounty%20of%20the%20Hunt&options=" data-card="Bounty of the Hunt">Bounty of the Hunt</a>.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lotus%20Petal&options=" data-card="Lotus Petal">Lotus Petal</a><br/>
Can allow you to drop an extra creature on the first turn or drop something bigger.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Elvish%20Spirit%20Guide&options=" data-card="Elvish Spirit Guide">Elvish Spirit Guide</a><br/>
<a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lotus%20Petal&options=" data-card="Lotus Petal">Lotus Petal</a> #4-6. Actually this one is better since it also cannot be countered (though I don&rsquo;t know why you would counter a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lotus%20Petal&options=" data-card="Lotus Petal">Lotus Petal</a>) and can be pitched to <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bounty%20of%20the%20Hunt&options=" data-card="Bounty of the Hunt">Bounty of the Hunt</a>. I think I even cast it once and beat down with it though that isn&rsquo;t likely to happen often.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Quirion%20Ranger&options=" data-card="Quirion Ranger">Quirion Ranger</a><br/>
With this in play you can run on one land. If you tap a land then bounce it and play it again you will have two mana. This also has great synergy with both <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Winter%20Orb&options=" data-card="Winter Orb">Winter Orb</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Spectral%20Bears&options=" data-card="Spectral Bears">Spectral Bears</a>.</p>

<h3>Mana I thought about but ended up not using:</h3>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pendelhaven&options=" data-card="Pendelhaven">Pendelhaven</a><br/>
While this was originally in the deck (the deck had more 1/1s at that time) I eventually pulled it when the number of 1/1s was reduced and it also can&rsquo;t be sacked to <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rogue%20Elephant&options=" data-card="Rogue Elephant">Rogue Elephant</a>.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Llanowar%20Elves&options=" data-card="Llanowar Elves">Llanowar Elves</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fyndhorn%20Elves&options=" data-card="Fyndhorn Elves">Fyndhorn Elves</a><br/>
These were in the early versions of the deck but ended up being way too slow. They allow you to drop an extra creature on turn 2 but you then don&rsquo;t get to attack with anything on turn 2. Dropping a threat was much more important on the first turn than setting up later mana. After all the deck doesn&rsquo;t need more than two. <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Quirion%20Ranger&options=" data-card="Quirion Ranger">Quirion Ranger</a> did much better in this slot in testing and was much more synergetic to the deck.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Treetop%20Village&options=" data-card="Treetop Village">Treetop Village</a><br/>
Coming into play tapped is like a death sentence for this deck. The game is normally over about the turn after this can come online.</p>

<h2>Creatures:</h2>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rogue%20Elephant&options=" data-card="Rogue Elephant">Rogue Elephant</a><br/>
Likely the best creature in the deck. This thing is three power for one mana. That is an amazing deal. Sacking a Forest isn&rsquo;t a major problem in a deck that can run on one land.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ghazban%20Ogre&options=" data-card="Ghazban Ogre">Ghazban Ogre</a><br/>
Generally you don&rsquo;t want to drop this guy first if you have other options, especially if your opponent is playing red. Once you get that first hit in however he basically losses his drawback and becomes a 2/2 for one mana.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Skyshroud%20Ridgeback&options=" data-card="Skyshroud Ridgeback">Skyshroud Ridgeback</a><br/>
This is likely the worst creature in the deck and the slot I am least happy with. On one hand he is another 2-power creature for one mana and the 3-toughness is also nice since he likely wont be trading with anything that early but the fading kinda sucks. He only gets in two hits. This would be the first creature I&rsquo;d change if I had a better option.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mtenda%20Lion&options=" data-card="Mtenda Lion">Mtenda Lion</a><br/>
Amazing if your opponent is not playing blue and pretty terrible if they are. This is another creature that isn&rsquo;t too exciting but I figured I&rsquo;d just board him out against blue decks.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jungle%20Lion&options=" data-card="Jungle Lion">Jungle Lion</a><br/>
The second-best one drop. There is no reason this deck would want to do much blocking baring <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Quirion%20Ranger&options=" data-card="Quirion Ranger">Quirion Ranger</a> tricks. As such this is essentially just a green <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Savannah%20Lions&options=" data-card="Savannah Lions">Savannah Lions</a>.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Albino%20Troll&options=" data-card="Albino Troll">Albino Troll</a><br/>
I knew I only wanted at max one creature with echo in the deck. This is by far the best choice. <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pouncing%20Jaguar&options=" data-card="Pouncing Jaguar">Pouncing Jaguar</a> is not even close to being this good. He still isn&rsquo;t that great as echo is very unpleasant. He will usually be the last creature you drop.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plant%20Elemental&options=" data-card="Plant Elemental">Plant Elemental</a><br/>
This was actually kinda disappointing. While it is huge and can even survive a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lightning%20Bolt&options=" data-card="Lightning Bolt">Lightning Bolt</a> he costs twice as much as <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rogue%20Elephant&options=" data-card="Rogue Elephant">Rogue Elephant</a> and only has an extra toughness to show for it.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Spectral%20Bears&options=" data-card="Spectral Bears">Spectral Bears</a><br/>
This is only usable because <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Quirion%20Ranger&options=" data-card="Quirion Ranger">Quirion Ranger</a> is in the deck. Without him it can be kinda bad but still not useless.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wild%20Mongrel&options=" data-card="Wild Mongrel">Wild Mongrel</a><br/>
I didn&rsquo;t have this in the deck originally and had <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Harvest%20Wurm&options=" data-card="Harvest Wurm">Harvest Wurm</a> in its space. I don&rsquo;t like using this card as I find it annoying but I gave it a try and found him amazing. I hate that he is so good. Stupid best bear ever.</p>

<h3>Creatures that were tested but didn&rsquo;t make the deck:</h3>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fallow%20Wurm&options=" data-card="Fallow Wurm">Fallow Wurm</a><br/>
You needed three mana plus a fourth in your hand. This was clogging up my hand a lot as this deck rarely gets that much mana.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Harvest%20Wurm&options=" data-card="Harvest Wurm">Harvest Wurm</a><br/>
This was not too bad and has decent synergy with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rogue%20Elephant&options=" data-card="Rogue Elephant">Rogue Elephant</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plant%20Elemental&options=" data-card="Plant Elemental">Plant Elemental</a> but was the card sitting dead in my hand more than any other. By the time you could cast him you likely would have been able to drop anything else a full turn earlier.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Basking%20Rootwalla&options=" data-card="Basking Rootwalla">Basking Rootwalla</a><br/>
Once I added <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wild%20Mongrel&options=" data-card="Wild Mongrel">Wild Mongrel</a> I wanted to see if these were worth using. They were not. Even on the rare occasions where I would draw one plus a Mongrel I would never have free mana to pump it essentially just making it a 1/1.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Skyshroud%20Elite&options=" data-card="Skyshroud Elite">Skyshroud Elite</a><br/>
This actually can be quite good considering the large quantity of nonbasics in our group (thank you Dustin). So why isn&rsquo;t it the deck? I don&rsquo;t have any and they aren&rsquo;t cheap. They probably would just be in the sideboard even if I did though.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pouncing%20Jaguar&options=" data-card="Pouncing Jaguar">Pouncing Jaguar</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cradle%20Guard&options=" data-card="Cradle Guard">Cradle Guard</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Acridian&options=" data-card="Acridian">Acridian</a><br/>
As I mentioned earlier one creature with echo is the most the deck can handle and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Albino%20Troll&options=" data-card="Albino Troll">Albino Troll</a> is better than these.</p>

<h2>Other Spells:</h2>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rancor&options=" data-card="Rancor">Rancor</a><br/>
This should probably be in any kind of stompy deck. It is absolutely amazing and turns anything into a serious threat. Dropping something like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rogue%20Elephant&options=" data-card="Rogue Elephant">Rogue Elephant</a> on turn one then dropping this on it turn two gives you a 5/3 trample you are attacking with on turn 2. That creature alone will kill the opponent on turn 5 if left unchecked. With even a small amount of assistance a turn 4 kill is quite likely.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bounty%20of%20the%20Hunt&options=" data-card="Bounty of the Hunt">Bounty of the Hunt</a><br/>
This is generally either used to deal the last few points of damage or to make sure your creature comes out on top when it is blocked. Unlike <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Giant%20Growth&options=" data-card="Giant Growth">Giant Growth</a> you don&rsquo;t need to keep a mana open which is actually not all that easy to do with this deck. It is also another use for those <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Land%20Grant&options=" data-card="Land Grant">Land Grants</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Elvish%20Spirit%20Guide&options=" data-card="Elvish Spirit Guide">Elvish Spirit Guides</a> when you no longer need the mana. Still one of the weaker cards in the deck though.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Winter%20Orb&options=" data-card="Winter Orb">Winter Orb</a><br/>
Since this deck can run on one land you wont even notice the effect yourself. It can cause some serious problems to mana hungry decks and buy you the time you need to win.</p>

<h3>Spells that didn&rsquo;t make the deck:</h3>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Overrun&options=" data-card="Overrun">Overrun</a><br/>
Too expensive. The deck doesn&rsquo;t usually reach 5 mana.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bonesplitter&options=" data-card="Bonesplitter">Bonesplitter</a><br/>
Not really all that bad but not even close to the power of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rancor&options=" data-card="Rancor">Rancor</a>. Honestly I would probably even use <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Armor%20of%20Thorns&options=" data-card="Armor of Thorns">Armor of Thorns</a> or <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Briar%20Shield&options=" data-card="Briar Shield">Briar Shield</a> over this.</p>

<h2>Playing the Deck:</h2>

<p>This will be short. Really all you do is play creatures and attack. Try to drop as many creatures as you can on turn 1. As for which creatures to drop first try to save creatures with echo for last and play the ones without drawbacks that affect your mana first. Against decks that pack mass removal make sure to hold some back so that you don&rsquo;t overextend and thus run out of gas.</p>

<h2>Re-Making the Deck:</h2>

<p>Since the deck is type 3 and we don&rsquo;t play that anymore I think it makes sense to port it to a different format. Back when I first built it this wouldn&rsquo;t be entirely possible because <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lotus%20Petal&options=" data-card="Lotus Petal">Lotus Petal</a> was restricted in vintage and banned elsewhere. Also Portal cards were not tournament legal. However since then Wizards basically reworked type 1.5 turning into Legacy. As luck would have it <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lotus%20Petal&options=" data-card="Lotus Petal">Lotus Petal</a> is fine for that format. Also they legalized Portal for Vintage and Legacy making it possible to make a direct port of the deck to Legacy. In fact the deck as it is right now is Legacy legal. However since you can have 4 copies of cards we definitely want to maximize the consistency of the deck.</p>

Because of this the deck could no longer support both <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rogue%20Elephant&options=" data-card="Rogue Elephant">Rogue Elephant</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plant%20Elemental&options=" data-card="Plant Elemental">Plant Elemental</a> so the weaker of the two was dropped.

    <id>http://spekkionu.github.io/2005/03/why-type-3</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As you all know by now the Type 3 format has two distinctive features.  One is that the maximum number of each card you can run is 3 instead of 4.  The other is that we control the banned/restricted list.  I&rsquo;m going to take a look at the type 3 format and discuss exactly what that 3-card limit means.  Then I&rsquo;m going to look at the types of decks most effected by the format.</p>

<p>This obviously means I&rsquo;ll be talking about consistency.  Really to maximize your consistency you want the largest percent of your deck to do the same thing possible.  This will allow you do that thing more often.  There are different ways of maximizing this percentage.  The first of course is to just play with less cards.  You will have a greater chance of drawing a specific card if there are less other cards in your deck.  A 60 card deck will certainly draw the single <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Yawgmoth&rsquo;s%20Will&options=" data-card="Yawgmoth&amp;rsquo;s Will">Yawgmoth&rsquo;s Will</a> you have in there more than an 80 card deck.  1/60 is a bigger number than 1/80.  Another way to maximize consistency is to run more copies each card in the deck.  A 60 card deck will certainly draw a card more often if it runs 4 copies of a card than if it runs only a single copy.  Once again 4/60 is a bigger number than 1/60.  Another way of maximizing consistency is to run tutors.  <a href="http://www.germagic.de/nda/deck.php?id=68">Randy Buehler&rsquo;s Pro Tour Chicago deck from 2000</a> ran 4 copies of both <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Necropotence&options=" data-card="Necropotence">Necropotence</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Demonic%20Consultation&options=" data-card="Demonic Consultation">Demonic Consultation</a>.  This basically makes the deck act like it has 8 copies of Necropotence.  Once again 8/60 is a bigger number than 4/60.  Similarly just drawing extra cards effectively reduces the size of your deck which increases your consistency.  The last way to maximize deck consistency is by running multiple cards that basically do the same thing.  This would be something like running 4 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lightning%20Bolt&options=" data-card="Lightning Bolt">Lightning Bolts</a>, 4 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Incinerate&options=" data-card="Incinerate">Incinerates</a>, and 4 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Chain%20Lightning&options=" data-card="Chain Lightning">Chain Lightnings</a> in your burn deck.  While these are functionally different cards they all pretty much do the same thing (3 damage).  Once again 12/60 is a bigger number than 4/60.  I will admit that there are plenty of cards out there that are unique enough that there really isn&rsquo;t anything similar enough to use as redundant copies but most aggro decks and many control decks use this method of consistency maximizing.</p>

<p>So it is obvious to see that reducing the card limit to 3 of each card rather than 4 makes it harder to maximize consistency.  I&rsquo;m now going to look at each major deck type and the effect this loss of consistency has on them.  I&rsquo;ll ignore our banned/restricted lists for these examples since it could vary depending on the decks that are abusive.</p>

<h3>Aggro:</h3>

<p>This is what I feel is the least effected archtype.  It is generally the most redundant archtype and as such will have plenty of similar cards to fill holes with.  I&rsquo;ll use an example:</p>

<p>This is a very consistent and pretty fast red aggro deck.  It also has a decent late game with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Grim%20Lavamancer&options=" data-card="Grim Lavamancer">Grim Lavamancer</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cursed%20Scroll&options=" data-card="Cursed Scroll">Cursed Scroll</a>.  Now lets see what it would take if we tried to convert it to type 3.  We can replace the two non-basic land slots with 2 more Mountains.  The rest leaves us with 10 free slots.  I&rsquo;d like to keep the deck running as close to the same as possible.  We&rsquo;ll add 3 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Incinerate&options=" data-card="Incinerate">Incinerate</a> to replace the missing burn.

<p>How has the performance of the deck changed?  Not really much at all.  It is about 1/3 of a turn slower but just as consistent as ever.  Type 3 has have a very minimal effect on it.  If aggro was strong in a normal environment it would continue to be strong in type 3.</p>

<h3>Control:</h3>

<p>At first you may think this archtype would be heavily effected by the lower consistency in type 3.  However it actually isn&rsquo;t that bad.  There are enough substitutes that the effect is still pretty minimal.  It is more effected than aggro but not by much.  I&rsquo;ll use a Draw Go deck as the example.</p>

</div></div></p>

<p>How does it stack up to the original.  Once again it isn&rsquo;t hurt quite as much as you&rsquo;d expect.  The most missed spells are the extra copies of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Force%20of%20Will&options=" data-card="Force of Will">Force of Will</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Nevinyrrals%20Disk&options=" data-card="Nevinyrrals Disk">Disk</a>.  Both have pseudo replacements though both are of a much lower power level.  Everything else is easily replaceable.  They may even games where this deck may perform better due to the extra free countermagic even if the deck has less hard counters.  This deck is still quite the powerhouse and would make most of you very unhappy to see me play.</p>

<h3>Combo:</h3>

<p>Here is where we see the effect of type 3.  Combo takes a huge hit to both consistency and speed.  The reason is that except in very rare cases a combo deck wants to find a few specific cards as fast as possible.  Not only does type 3 remove a copy of each of those cards it also removes a copy of each of the cards used to find them.  Finding redundant replacements for creatures or removal is easy.  Tutors tend to make a much bigger drop in power level when you have to run the second rate options.  Sam has explained that Type 3 was originally created because his group was very annoyed that the environment was dominated by combo.  While I wasn&rsquo;t around as much back then I&rsquo;d be willing to be this was when type 2 was Tempest and Urza block, which was the most dominant combo ever was in type 2.  I&rsquo;d try to use another example here to try and convert a combo deck to type 3 but I really suck at combo and would likely start with a combo deck that is already terrible.  If I used a proven tournament combo deck I&rsquo;d probably ruin it just from lack of understanding.  I do think it should be obvious enough that it would not stand up to the changes near as well as control or aggro.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>So we have concluded that the only archtype that is hit hard by the 3-card limit is combo.  Type 3 also has a few innocent bystander cards that are now quite terrible because of the limit.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Accumulated%20Knowledge&options=" data-card="Accumulated Knowledge">Accumulated Knowledge</a> goes from being an excellent card drawing spell to being quite terrible.  Similar things can be said of the Oddessy burst cycle and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kindle&options=" data-card="Kindle">Kindle</a>.  It also broke a few cards such as <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jester&rsquo;s%20Cap&options=" data-card="Jester&amp;rsquo;s Cap">Jester&rsquo;s Cap</a>, which we even had to eventually restrict.  The fact that it can remove all copies of a card rather than leave one make it a much more powerful weapon (or at least more annoying).  What I think really suffers though is any deck based around a single card.  I&rsquo;m not talking about combo decks but stupid things like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Chance%20Encounter&options=" data-card="Chance Encounter">Chance Encounter</a> decks or something based around other dumb cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shared%20Fate&options=" data-card="Shared Fate">Shared Fate</a> or <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Timesifter&options=" data-card="Timesifter">Timesifter</a>.  We started playing type 3 because we wanted to weaken the environment to allow stupid decks to be played.  Since our environment had trouble not with combo but with control I don&rsquo;t think it was the correct call.  After all I think the type 3 environment made control dominate even more.  It certainly seem to win every week regardless of who played it.  This was because the stupid decks were hurt by the 3-card limit more than the dominating control decks.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sound completely negative about type 3.  It had one feature that made me really like it.  That was the fact that we controlled the banned/restricted list.  This is what I think made the format fun.  If we were to start playing a constructed format again it probably should be either an existing sanctioned format or a new home-brewed format with our own banned/restricted lists but with a 4 of each card limit.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since my personal preference is also Wednesday and no one else really had a preference I&rsquo;ll be throwing up a new article every Wednesday starting next week.  For this one I wanted to wait at least a week mostly just to give people time to read some of those articles.  Some were in fact quite lengthy and I know everyone isn&rsquo;t as crazy as I am and would read them all in one sitting, especially some of the ones that were slightly above your head (they were at least slightly above my head).  I wanted to get that first post out of the way at the beginning because I felt as though it was the perfect place to start.  It isn&rsquo;t like I&rsquo;ll ever be able to come up with any new ideas that totally redefine how people think about magic.  I&rsquo;d be lucky to come up with ideas that redefine my own thoughts about magic.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Today&rsquo;s topic is going to be mostly type 3.5 specific but will apply to any constructed format.  I&rsquo;m sure everyone noticed I seemed to win the type 3 tournaments were having almost every other week.  I probably ended up winning about 65% of them or so.  Play skill of course always plays a big portion in how well you do but that isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;m going to look at today.  Besides I believe Dustin is at the very least equal to me in pure play skill terms and in many cases better.  I&rsquo;m probably a bit better at playing control or at least the control mirror but he is either equal or better than me at playing pretty much every other archetype.  I&rsquo;d also like to mention the rest of the group is a lot better than they usually get credit for.  BJ has been playing for long enough that I don&rsquo;t need to lump him in this category.  I think the only reason he hasn&rsquo;t been doing as well lately is because he has been borrowing other people&rsquo;s decks rather than playing his own.  Kim is improving a lot and really the only thing holding her back is that her collection is more static than many of us because she is responsible enough not to spend all her money on magic cards.  In fact it seems the largest reason for Kim to get new cards is because they have pretty art, not that that is a bad reason.  Branden has been playing for less time than the rest of the group and I think started playing sometime during Mirrodin block.  He has improved a large amount recently and I don&rsquo;t expect this to stop anytime soon.  He is not near as terrible as most people are during their first year or two of playing.  His decks are better than he might give them credit for as well.  While most of them could use a few tweaks here and there and possibly a more stable mana base they seem to all be built around strong concepts.</p>

<p>Getting back on topic the things I want to talk about today though all take place before the tournament starts.</p>

<p>The first step is of course deciding on and building a deck.  If each of you were to be honest, how far in advance did you usually have your decks built?  I remember many a time when Dustin would IM me on Friday afternoon declaring he had no idea what to play or would be putting the deck together as people arrived.  I think I built more of Kim&rsquo;s type 3 decks than she did and that was ususally 5 minutes before we started.  I will admit some of my decks were built the night before the tournament but most were built at least a week in advance.  In fact the ones that were built the day before also were the ones that didn&rsquo;t do so well.  Why is it important to build the decks in advance?  So you can test them.</p>

<p>There are many ways you can test a deck without an extra person handy (though that would be the best method if possible).  The first thing you should do after throwing a deck together is to shuffle it up and just draw a few hands and maybe play the first few turns of a game.  This is mostly to make sure the mana base is decent.  You want to pay attention to whether you draw enough land or even too much land early in the game.  If there is a problem make some small adjustments like adding or removing a land or two.  Some people have a knack for being able to just know the correct mana base for a deck just by looking at it but I&rsquo;m not one of them.  I&rsquo;m usually close but a few tweaks are often necessary.  Another way of going through a few goldfish games is to use a program like <a href="http://www.e-league.com/">Apprentice</a> or <a href="http://www.magicworkstation.com/">Magic Workstation</a>.  These programs let you build decks and goldfish them.  I much prefer Magic Workstation as it will also let you test the deck in the mirror match, or if you pay for the program, against another deck you have built.  Both will let you play against other people online but I don&rsquo;t like trying to play actual games with these programs.  These programs also don&rsquo;t know magic rules so it is mostly just a digital playing mat that will shuffle your deck for you.  That said I got so much use out of Magic Workstation that after debating it for a few months I eventually ended up paying for the full version so I could use it to test decks against other decks.  After the mana base is stable the next step is to test the deck against actual disruption.  There are multiple ways to do this.  One is to build a different generic test deck to play against your deck.  You just basically take turns swapping between decks and playing both sides.  It looks really stupid and may make you feel like a loser (It is sort of like playing Monopoly by yourself.) but it will drastically help you get a feel for how your deck performs in an actual game.  There are some problems such as the fact that you know what in both players hands (since both are you) which makes things like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cabal%20Therapy&options=" data-card="Cabal Therapy">Cabal Therapy</a> hard to play.  You basically have to try and figure out what you&rsquo;d name if you didn&rsquo;t know what your opponent was holding.  Other problems include thinks like knowing when mass removal is coming so you don&rsquo;t overextend or knowing when to not counter a spell because a worse one is coming up but these problems don&rsquo;t actually affect too much.  After all it isn&rsquo;t like you are trying to make the pro tour or anything, just play in a 4-6 person casual tournament.  You generally want to test your deck against a couple different deck types.  Maybe a few aggressive decks, some with removal and some without.  Then against a few more controlling decks of different types.  This can help you find a deck&rsquo;s weakness which will help you try and fix it.  This testing always provides good results and always results in me changing parts of my deck.  The decks I bring to the tournaments (or even just have in the box) are never the same decks I first put together.  Ever.  I absolutely can&rsquo;t just sit down and throw together an optimal decklist, even of an archetype I play often.  When I skipped this testing I often discovered major problems with the deck during the tournament where it is much too late to fix. During the first tournament I had all my removal in the sideboard and lost to decks playing with cheap creatures.  I had planned on fetching it with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cunning%20Wish&options=" data-card="Cunning Wish">Cunning Wish</a> but it ended up way too slow.  I remember getting beat down by things like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Merfolk%20Looter&options=" data-card="Merfolk Looter">Merfolk Looter</a> before I had the mana to cast the Wish and the fetched removal spell.  A deck that can&rsquo;t handle a 1/1 for 1U has some major problems.  I wound up tying for last place even though the deck had more powerful cards than anyone else&rsquo;s.  Even multiple copies of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Force%20of%20Will&options=" data-card="Force of Will">Force of Will</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fact%20or%20Fiction&options=" data-card="Fact or Fiction">Fact or Fiction</a> and plenty more broken cards didn&rsquo;t stop me from getting trampled by crappy creatures.  I would have been able to notice this if I had played even a single game with the deck before the tournament.</p>

<p>The other thing I want to talk about is Metagaming.  This to put it as simply as possible is just what you expect there to be at the tournament.  While you can certainly build a metagame deck this usually has to do with the contents of your sideboard.  Remember that you play between 50% and 67% of your games after sideboarding.  This makes them very important.  The main reason I want to talk about metagaming is that in our group (at least in type 3) it seems to be nearly impossible to do.  I think the main reason for this is the fact that all of us seemed to have the unwritten rule of never playing the same deck twice.  This means that the metagame is completely different every week.  There are however certain patterns you can detect.  As I&rsquo;m sure everyone noticed I am quite fond of control decks.  Not just draw go but control of every type and color.  I didn&rsquo;t play control every week but it was more than 50%.  I also tend to avoid combo.  I really just don&rsquo;t like combo decks very much unless they are very fast and consistent and those tend to be broken and thus contain cards I can&rsquo;t afford.  I actually think I would even like a good combo deck.  In other words I probably wont be playing combo (though I wouldn&rsquo;t say never).  I&rsquo;m also quite fond of mass removal so never overextend.  Discard and land destruction is useful but take it easy on the land destruction.  No one likes it in casual.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Armageddon&options=" data-card="Armageddon">Armageddon</a> is fine unless it is multiplayer (where each time it is cast it seems to add an hour to the game and no one wants to play one game until 3:00 AM).  I&rsquo;ve noticed Branden has a tendency to have either black or red (or both) in his decks and they tend to be on the aggressive side.  This means pack color hosers like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Chill&options=" data-card="Chill">Chill</a> or <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Light%20of%20Day&options=" data-card="Light of Day">Light of Day</a> and/or mass removal like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pyroclasm&options=" data-card="Pyroclasm">Pyroclasm</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wrath%20of%20God&options=" data-card="Wrath of God">Wrath of God</a>.  BJ tends to lean towards either aggressive green decks with things like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Overrun&options=" data-card="Overrun">Overrun</a> or defensive white decks with life gain and damage prevention.  Mass removal is excellent against the former and the latter is only a problem if you are playing a super aggressive deck (especially an aggressive red deck).  Cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sulfuric%20Vortex&options=" data-card="Sulfuric Vortex">Sulfuric Vortex</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Flaring%20Pain&options=" data-card="Flaring Pain">Flaring Pain</a> can certainly help in those cases.  The rest of the group is much more random but Kim&rsquo;s best decks seem to be B/W aggro control or decks with lots of bounce.  The bounce is likely more fun to <del>play</del> annoy people with but the B/W ones are much more powerful.  Then again <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Desolation%20Angel&options=" data-card="Desolation Angel">Desolation Angels</a> tend to be like that.  Bounce isn&rsquo;t as effective against creatures that cost less than the bounce spells and you&rsquo;ll probably want to either counter that <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Desolation%20Angel&options=" data-card="Desolation Angel">Desolation Angel</a> or keep her from getting 7 mana.  Dustin is very hard to peg down as there really isn&rsquo;t anything he doesn&rsquo;t play.  He does tend to gravitate toward certain colors for periods of time though (I think he is at the U/G stage right now).  He does tend to lean slightly to the control side though so things like discard is helpful.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Disenchant&options=" data-card="Disenchant">Disenchants</a> are always useful.  He never builds decks without targets.  He also runs more non-basic lands than the rest of us so cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sowing%20Salt&options=" data-card="Sowing Salt">Sowing Salt</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dwarven%20Blastminer&options=" data-card="Dwarven Blastminer">Dwarven Blastminer</a> can be useful against him.  These of course all just tendencies and everyone breaks them often.  However knowing the tendedcies of the players in your group can really help you not have any useless cards in your sideboard.</p>
