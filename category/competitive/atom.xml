    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that it is over I&rsquo;ll be taking a look at the world&rsquo;s National&rsquo;s results (or at least the ones where Saviors was legal) to see how the Standard format ended up.  This is mostly as a review of what the format ended up being since 9th Edition is legal in the next large Standard tournament.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>First up is the biggest one.  US Nationals.  There was a period of time where US Nationals was considered the hardest tournament in the world to win.  It had not only had the best players in the world but was also just plain huge.  Making top 8 of a 400+ player event is hard enough but when the best players in the world fill the tournament it becomes even harder.  Since then the quality of the American magic players has declined somewhat and the rest of the world has gotten much better.  It is still probably in the top 3 hardest countries to top 8 in but I don&rsquo;t know whether it is harder than countries like France and Japan that are dominating the Pro Tour at the moment. Well anyway on with the results.</p>

<p>What is amazing about this tournament is that there is no Tooth in the top 8 at all.  It was not only the generally accepted best deck in Standard but was also the most common deck people brought to the tournament.  Also worth noting is that there are 4 blue decks in the top 8.  So much for people saying blue is dead.  The Flores Red deck is card for card the exact copy of Flores' deck from his original article creating the archetype (which is no longer premium so it readable by the masses).  The winning Blue Tron deck splashed black for <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cranial%20Extraction&options=" data-card="Cranial Extraction">Cranial Extraction</a> in the sideboard to help with the Tooth matchup.  The WW deck was the only one to do even remotely decent in the tournament and likely did so because of a lot of luck and the maindeck <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Worship&options=" data-card="Worship">Worships</a>.</p>

<p>The Beacon deck is a little unexpected but is more likely due to randomness and player skill than a tier 1 deck.  It isn&rsquo;t unusual for a random deck to sneak into a top 8.  As a deck the Beacon Green deck lost a lot of power when the metagame shifted with the release of Saviors.  Also the removal of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plow%20Under&options=" data-card="Plow Under">Plow Under</a> pretty much finishes it off.</p>

<p>It seems as though there are always blue control decks in the top 8 of major French tournaments even when they are supposedly not viable.  This was the first post-saviors Nationals data was received for and the first time MUC (not Tron) looked to be anything but a crappy deck.  I believe it was also the first big success of the Blue Tron decks.  Before this it had a lot of Premier Event top 8s on Magic Online but not much else.  The real oddball is the <a href="http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=12520">Mono Blue Aggro deck</a>.  It has <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Erayo,%20Soratami%20Ascendant&options=" data-card="Erayo, Soratami Ascendant">Erayo, Soratami Ascendant</a> but isn&rsquo;t one of those Erayo Affinity decks like <a href="http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=11970">the one from Regionals</a>.  If anything it most closely resembles a deck like Blue Skies.  A bunch of small flyers and a bit of countermagic and bounce.  It has a few things going for it but doesn&rsquo;t look to be a great deck.  Just someone that got a bit lucky and likely outplayed a few people with superior decks.</p>

<p>The Mono Black control deck is a bit random but not too surprising.  There are a lot of powerful black cards around right now.  Unfortunately this is about the only time one had done well recently.</p>

<p>Aggro Red got more top 8s than any other archetype but only one win.  Tooth took home the most first place trophies despite having 2 less top 8s.  The surprise comes from the fact that Rats got so many top 8s.  While it didn&rsquo;t win any tournaments it got 7 top 8s which is the same as Tooth and more than the Blue Tron decks that people are touting as the new &ldquo;best deck.&rdquo;  This is certainly enough to prove that it is much more than a rogue underpowered deck and is a fine choice for a major tournament.  Post rotation it shouldn&rsquo;t do anything but get better with access to <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hypnotic%20Specter&options=" data-card="Hypnotic Specter">Hypnotic Specter</a>.  The Specter fits almost perfectly into the deck already.  Also note that most of the lists here didn&rsquo;t try and concentrate on &ldquo;cute&rdquo; locks with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Chittering%20Rats&options=" data-card="Chittering Rats">Chittering Rats</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Skull%20Collector&options=" data-card="Skull Collector">Skull Collector</a>.  Some ran one or both of those cards but not in the quantities that would give you a realistic chance of getting the lock.  Instead they just used little beaters and small bits of disruption and card advantage to squeeze out the win.</p>

    <updated>2005-07-27T12:57:33-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.spekkionu.com/2005/07/the-standard-metagame-after-the-rotation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished going over the Standard format as it looked at Regionals.  This format however is as good as gone though.  By the time the next large Standard tournament comes around 9th Edition will have rotated in and 8th will be gone.  This week I&rsquo;m going to look at what will leave and how that affects the decks out there then look at what new cards are coming in then I&rsquo;m going to build a new deck using 9th Edition (I wont make any promises as to whether is is good or not).</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>What is leaving Standard?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll really only be looking at cards that are currently seeing tournament play.  Sure things like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ensnaring%20Bridge&options=" data-card="Ensnaring Bridge">Ensnaring Bridge</a> will also be leaving but since that isn&rsquo;t in any decks right now it wont effect the environment.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=City%20of%20Brass&options=" data-card="City of Brass">City of Brass</a><br/>
While this is pretty significant with all 10 pain lands coming back I doubt it will matter much at all.  Also <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tendo%20Ice%20Bridge&options=" data-card="Tendo Ice Bridge">Tendo Ice Bridge</a> is a very solid 5-color land.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Karma&options=" data-card="Karma">Karma</a><br/>
It isn&rsquo;t really seeing play but black is and this leaving will make things much safer for that approach.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Inspiration&options=" data-card="Inspiration">Inspiration</a><br/>
This is a significant thing to notice because it seems Wizards has decided even instant speed card drawing this bad is too good for blue.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Intruder%20Alarm&options=" data-card="Intruder Alarm">Intruder Alarm</a><br/>
While not a really successful deck there were a few <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Intruder%20Alarm&options=" data-card="Intruder Alarm">Intruder Alarm</a> combo decks out there which will be gone now.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Twiddle&options=" data-card="Twiddle">Twiddle</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Unsummon&options=" data-card="Unsummon">Unsummon</a><br/>
Neither see play but we have never had a base set without them before so I wanted to mention them anyway.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Birds%20of%20Paradise&options=" data-card="Birds of Paradise">Birds of Paradise</a><br/>
This is the big one.  While it will be in Ravinca it will have rotated out of the environment for a few months first.  Mono Green decks would be just as happy if not even more so with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Llanowar%20Elves&options=" data-card="Llanowar Elves">Llanowar Elves</a> (much better with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Umezawa&rsquo;s%20Jitte&options=" data-card="Umezawa&amp;rsquo;s Jitte">Umezawa&rsquo;s Jitte</a>) but the multicolor decks will really miss the Birds.  With the amount of good color fixing cards in the environment and the addition of the pain lands I think 5-color green decks can survive until Ranvinca just fine though.  Also there always is <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Utopia%20Tree&options=" data-card="Utopia Tree">Utopia Tree</a> but I doubt it&rsquo;ll be necessary.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boil&options=" data-card="Boil">Boil</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Choke&options=" data-card="Choke">Choke</a><br/>
While <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boil&options=" data-card="Boil">Boil</a> just becomes the sorcery speed <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boiling%20Seas&options=" data-card="Boiling Seas">Boiling Seas</a> <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Choke&options=" data-card="Choke">Choke</a> is replaced with the completely ignorable <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=River%20Bear&options=" data-card="River Bear">River Bear</a>.  Being an instant is a very significant part of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boil&options=" data-card="Boil">Boil</a>.  One of the more common uses for it wasn&rsquo;t just to blow up islands but to tap out the blue mage.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boil&options=" data-card="Boil">Boil</a> is a must-counter spell (obviously) so casting it at the end of your opponent&rsquo;s turn can give you the time you need to force a spell through on your turn.  Will the lacking color hosers make blue too good?  Likely not as long as <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boseiju&options=" data-card="Boseiju">Boseiju</a> is around.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plow%20Under&options=" data-card="Plow Under">Plow Under</a><br/>
This is probably the biggest effect 9th will have on existing decks.  Green is by far the most played color and every deck that has access to green generally wants 4 of these.  It is absolutely essential in fighting against Tooth.  Losing one of the best anti-Tooth weapons out there will not be a good thing.  At least Ravinca will make <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tooth%20and%20Nail&options=" data-card="Tooth and Nail">Tooth and Nail</a> leave so it will only be for a few months.</p>

<p>That isn&rsquo;t a whole lot of important cards.  The only ones that are even really all that important are <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plow%20Under&options=" data-card="Plow Under">Plow Under</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Birds%20of%20Paradise&options=" data-card="Birds of Paradise">Birds of Paradise</a>.  I am a little worried that Tooth will be a problem without <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plow%20Under&options=" data-card="Plow Under">Plow Under</a>, especially since adding <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kodama&rsquo;s%20Reach&options=" data-card="Kodama&amp;rsquo;s Reach">Kodama&rsquo;s Reach</a> made the deck much more resilient to <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sowing%20Salt&options=" data-card="Sowing Salt">Sowing Salt</a>.</p>

<h2>What New Cards are Entering Standard?</h2>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ll take a look at cards that 9th will bring that might see play.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Blinking%20Spirit&options=" data-card="Blinking Spirit">Blinking Spirit</a><br/>
It isn&rsquo;t exactly as powerful as is once was but this time around it has one very large bonus.  Look at that creature type.  I wonder if there could be anything out there that would benefit from a Spirit you could cast over and over.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gift%20of%20Estates&options=" data-card="Gift of Estates">Gift of Estates</a><br/>
Not really a major addition but this is a solid card that might see play.  I just wish it was <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tithe&options=" data-card="Tithe">Tithe</a>.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Marble%20Titan&options=" data-card="Marble Titan">Marble Titan</a><br/>
I don&rsquo;t think this will see play but in combination with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Reverence&options=" data-card="Reverence">Reverence</a> it could make beatdown decks of all sizes have problems.  Then again <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ghostly%20Prison&options=" data-card="Ghostly Prison">Ghostly Prison</a> is better against practically everything.</p>

<p><a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Paladin%20en-Vec&options=" data-card="Paladin en-Vec">Paladin en-Vec</a><br/>
Could be a very solid addition to White Weenie.  This wouldn&rsquo;t magically make the archetype better though.  WW&rsquo;s problems are not from a lack of good creatures.</p>

White can now dig out the Urzatron or just have access to a good card advantage engine.  This might even be enough to make Mono White Control viable.</p>

I think it should be pretty obvious by now that there is likely going to be some sort of mono black aggro or aggro control deck around.  There is almost no way this wont see play.</p>

Now is the time to find out if this is really a great card or if was just the existence of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Forbid&options=" data-card="Forbid">Forbid</a> that made this see play.  In my times using it I&rsquo;ve often been a bit disappointed so I&rsquo;d actually fall more towards the latter.  I do still love the card and am glad to see it here.  It will probably just sit there like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hammer%20of%20Bogardan&options=" data-card="Hammer of Bogardan">Hammer of Bogardan</a> did though.</p>

This card falls into the same boat.  It was amazing in Urza block but saw no play in 7th.  Likely this was due to the fact that the deck that ran it in Urza block also had 4 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Grim%20Monolith&options=" data-card="Grim Monolith">Grim Monoliths</a>, 4 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thran%20Dynamo&options=" data-card="Thran Dynamo">Thran Dynamo</a>, 4 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Voltaic%20Key&options=" data-card="Voltaic Key">Voltaic Keys</a>, and a few <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fire%20Diamond&options=" data-card="Fire Diamond">Fire Diamonds</a> as well as <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Temporal%20Aperture&options=" data-card="Temporal Aperture">Temporal Aperture</a> to cast it for free.  It does however blow up weenies as well as Tooth&rsquo;s precious lands so maybe it will see play.</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s Make a Deck:</h2>

<p>While some cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Paladin%20en-Vec&options=" data-card="Paladin en-Vec">Paladin en-Vec</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cruel%20Edict&options=" data-card="Cruel Edict">Cruel Edict</a> can be quite good they would likely just go into an existing deck (like WW and MBC respectively).  I&rsquo;m looking for something that would either inspire a completely new deck or at least cause some drastic changes to an existing one.  I can see a couple of options.</p>

<p>Option 1: Mono Black Aggro-Control<br/>
This is almost entirely made possible by <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hypnotic%20Specter&options=" data-card="Hypnotic Specter">Hypnotic Specter</a>.  It would essentially be a bunch of creatures, discard, and removal.  Actually now that I think about it the Ninja Rats deck is essentially just that.  The Specter is certainly good enough to work his way into that deck.  I guess this isn&rsquo;t really an option after all.</p>

<p>Option 2: <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Form%20of%20the%20Dragon&options=" data-card="Form of the Dragon">Form of the Dragon</a>.dec<br/>
This one is likely a bit more tournament viable.  However I&rsquo;m not sure how successful this would be either.  Onslaught block didn&rsquo;t have <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lantern%20Kami&options=" data-card="Lantern Kami">Lantern Kamis</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Suntail%20Hawk&options=" data-card="Suntail Hawk">Suntail Hawks</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Leonin%20Skyhunter&options=" data-card="Leonin Skyhunter">Leonin Skyhunters</a> beating down at the low end and a bunch of Dragons and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Meloku%20the%20Clouded%20Mirror&options=" data-card="Meloku the Clouded Mirror">Meloku the Clouded Mirror</a> at the high end.  There was pretty much just <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Akroma,%20Angel%20of%20Wrath&options=" data-card="Akroma, Angel of Wrath">Akroma</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rorix%20Bladewing&options=" data-card="Rorix Bladewing">Rorix</a> at that time period.  It would however pwn green decks without <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Naturalize&options=" data-card="Naturalize">Naturalize</a> or <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Viridian%20Zealot&options=" data-card="Viridian Zealot">Viridian Zealot</a>.</p>

<p>Option 3: <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wildfire&options=" data-card="Wildfire">Wildfire</a>.dec<br/>
This one I like.  What does Tooth hate to see most?  Land Destruction.  What do aggro green and WW hate to see most?  Mass creature removal.  This is both in one.  It does cost 6 mana though so it may be too slow.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shard%20Phoenix&options=" data-card="Shard Phoenix">Shard Phoenix</a>.dec is another option but it would likely just be easier to drop a copy or two into a Big Red deck.</p>

<p>Option 4: Mono White Control<br/>
With <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Weathered%20Wayfarer&options=" data-card="Weathered Wayfarer">Weathered Wayfarer</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gift%20of%20Estates&options=" data-card="Gift of Estates">Gift of Estates</a> white actually has access to a card advantage engine.  Is this enough to make a white control deck possible?  Possibly.  Would it need a second color?  I&rsquo;m not sure without a bit of testing.</p>

<h3>My Choice:</h3>

<p>Options 3 and 4 are the ones that interest me the most but I&rsquo;m not really sure which one I like more.  I&rsquo;ll just cheat and build both.</p>

<h2>Building <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wildfire&options=" data-card="Wildfire">Wildfire</a>.dec:</h2>

<p>Normally I would look at past decks that have used the card and see if a similar approach is necessary.  With <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wildfire&options=" data-card="Wildfire">Wildfire</a> however this isn&rsquo;t going to be very helpful.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wildfire&options=" data-card="Wildfire">Wildfire</a> was first printed during Urza Block.  As I&rsquo;m sure you are all aware of by now this wasn&rsquo;t exactly the time of balanced cards.  Well lets just look at the Tempest/Urza block Standard <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wildfire&options=" data-card="Wildfire">Wildfire</a> decks.

<p>Looking at this list really drives home how crazy the environment was at this time.  Lets look at nothing but the mana acceleration in the deck.<br/>

<p>You can try all you want to blame the broken environment on the expensive broken cards in the environment but this isn&rsquo;t the real reason for the craziness.  Sure of course powerful 5-6 mana cards are going to be broken when you can cast them on turn 2-3 practically every game.  This is roughly twice the amount of mana acceleration that a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tooth%20and%20Nail&options=" data-card="Tooth and Nail">Tooth and Nail</a> deck runs and they want to cast a 9 mana sorcery.</p>

<p>Wizards has since learned the lesson about cards that produce more mana than they cost.  You wont see more <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Grim%20Monolith&options=" data-card="Grim Monolith">Grim Monoliths</a> and lands like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ancient%20Tomb&options=" data-card="Ancient Tomb">Ancient Tomb</a> nowadays.

Clearly we aren&rsquo;t going to make the deck work like this.  So how can we get access to lots of mana?</p>

<p>Though artifact mana certainly combos much better with blowing up lands all we really have is the Talismans, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gilded%20Lotus&options=" data-card="Gilded Lotus">Gilded Lotus</a> and a bunch of mediocre crap.  What we do have though is green land search.  And boy do we have that.</p>

<p>Actually before I went through any of this thinking process I first tried to add <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wildfire&options=" data-card="Wildfire">Wildfire</a> to some Big Red type deck.  While that worked out okay I think this make for a more interesting article and likely a better deck (if not I&rsquo;ll just go back to mono-red).</p>

</div></div></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t worry about the mana curve or color distribution or how many legends to run or anything like that at this point.  I just wanted to see if I could cast quick <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wildfire&options=" data-card="Wildfire">Wildfires</a> and that they would do anything.</p>

<p>After a few goldfishes and test matches against existing deck I noticed a few big problems with it.</p>

<p>First <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Molder%20Slug&options=" data-card="Molder Slug">Molder Slug</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sensei&rsquo;s%20Divining%20Top&options=" data-card="Sensei&amp;rsquo;s Divining Top">Sensei&rsquo;s Divining Top</a> are not a combo and feel stupid not noticing before I tested.  I didn&rsquo;t even notice until they were both in play and I was all like Crap!  Not quite as bad as putting man-lands and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Chimeric%20Idol&options=" data-card="Chimeric Idol">Chimeric Idol</a> in the same deck, which I&rsquo;ve done more than once and have seen Dustin do as well (We suck at Magic) but still pretty stupid.  Also the deck has a lot of expensive spells and not enough to help it live through the early game.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if the deck likes the Top or the Slug more.  The Top is great and there are a decent amount of shuffle effects but <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Molder%20slug&options=" data-card="Molder slug">Molder slug</a> is very helpful against practically everyone and also survives <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wildfire&options=" data-card="Wildfire">Wildfire</a>.  In the end I went with the Top because if I need artifact removal I can just add something different and the Top adds something you can&rsquo;t really get elsewhere.  To fill in the holes I added 4 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pyroclasm&options=" data-card="Pyroclasm">Pyroclasm</a> to help with the early game.  I also pulled 2 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Iwamori&options=" data-card="Iwamori">Iwamori</a> for 2 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Crucible%20of%20Worlds&options=" data-card="Crucible of Worlds">Crucible of Worlds</a> mostly because it looked fun and would let me recover from <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wildfire&options=" data-card="Wildfire">Wildfire</a> faster.  4 copies of a single legend were too many anyway.  This lowers the mana curve of the deck by quite a bit and hopefully fixes some of the problems.</p>

<p>After testing it again it ran a lot more smoothly.  It was pretty good against creature based decks like MGA and WW and about even with MUC.  It had some issues with Tooth but what deck doesn&rsquo;t.  I threw a bunch of land destruction in the sideboard and which made that matchup a lot easier (but still about even).  One problem with my testing is that the test decks are all pre 9th rotation and many times the Wildfire deck lost due to multiple <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plow%20Under&options=" data-card="Plow Under">Plow Unders</a> which wont even be legal post rotation.  I&rsquo;d have to update the test decks and make a complete sideboard to really test the deck but I really just wanted something rough to think about at this point.</p>

<p>The final (at least for now) version of the deck looks like this:</p>

<p>Likely it will be pretty good against aggro decks like Beacon Green and White Weenie but I doubt it stands even a remote chance against Tooth and will have problems with any of the other control decks in the environment.</p>

<p>After testing it a bit I found most of my predictions to be quite accurate.  It just plain cannot win against Tooth.  It doesn&rsquo;t have any way to either prevent the Tooth deck from getting to 9 mana or from finding and resolving <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tooth%20and%20Nail&options=" data-card="Tooth and Nail">Tooth and Nail</a>.  The Tooth deck basically gets to goldfish while you sit there and do a bunch of nothing.  Its only hope is a lucky <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mindslaver&options=" data-card="Mindslaver">Mindslaver</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the deck isn&rsquo;t as good against aggro as I had hoped either.  Often against WW <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wrath%20of%20God&options=" data-card="Wrath of God">Wrath of God</a> was too slow and the amount of damage you would take before you could cast it was more than you can handle.  Something like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Chrome%20Mox&options=" data-card="Chrome Mox">Chrome Mox</a> or <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wayfarer&rsquo;s%20Bauble&options=" data-card="Wayfarer&amp;rsquo;s Bauble">Wayfarer&rsquo;s Bauble</a> would likely fix this as casting <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wrath%20of%20God&options=" data-card="Wrath of God">Wrath</a> on turn 3 is much better.</p>

<p>With this in mind I worked on coming up with ways to solve these problems.  Some <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wayfarer&rsquo;s%20Bauble&options=" data-card="Wayfarer&amp;rsquo;s Bauble">Wayfarer&rsquo;s Baubles</a> would fix the White Weenie problem but the only way I can think of to fix the control matchup is to splash another color for disruption.  The most obvious choice would be to splash black for <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cranial%20Extraction&options=" data-card="Cranial Extraction">Cranial Extraction</a>.  This alone wont be enough to fix the Tooth matchup but it hopefully will buy enough time to activate a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mindslaver&options=" data-card="Mindslaver">Mindslaver</a>.</p>

<h3>The new version looks like this:</h3>

<p>The Urzatron proved to be a bit easier to handle than <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cloudpost&options=" data-card="Cloudpost">Cloudpost</a>.  While the deck never had a problem assembling 3+ <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cloudpost&options=" data-card="Cloudpost">Cloudposts</a> it often had problems using the mana.  It was quite often that the deck had to either take mana burn or tap mostly <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plains&options=" data-card="Plains">Plains</a> to cast its spells.

<p>Now that the deck has enough shuffle effects <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sensei&rsquo;s%20Divining%20Top&options=" data-card="Sensei&amp;rsquo;s Divining Top">Sensei&rsquo;s Divining Top</a> is an obvious inclusion.  I went for the <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bringer%20of%20the%20White%20Dawn&options=" data-card="Bringer of the White Dawn">Bringer of the White Dawn</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mindslaver&options=" data-card="Mindslaver">Mindslaver</a> lock over beating with a large creature because it proved to be more reliable.</p>

<p>Overall the deck is still not very good.  While it isn&rsquo;t terrible it just seems to be inferior to a mono black control deck in almost every way.  White has <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wrath%20of%20God&options=" data-card="Wrath of God">Wrath of God</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Final%20Judgment&options=" data-card="Final Judgment">Final Judgment</a> to clear the board but black has <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hideous%20Laughter&options=" data-card="Hideous Laughter">Hideous Laughter</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Night%20of%20Souls'%20Betrayal&options=" data-card="Night of Souls&apos; Betrayal">Night of Souls' Betrayal</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kagemaro,%20First%20to%20Suffer&options=" data-card="Kagemaro, First to Suffer">Kagemaro, First to Suffer</a> which aren&rsquo;t really any worse.  It as much better spot creature removal, has actual card drawing, and has disruption for control decks.  The only thing it doesn&rsquo;t have is a good mana engine but <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wayfarer&rsquo;s%20Bauble&options=" data-card="Wayfarer&amp;rsquo;s Bauble">Wayfarer&rsquo;s Bauble</a> + <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Solemn%20Simulacrum&options=" data-card="Solemn Simulacrum">Solemn Simulacrum</a> is probably enough anyway.</p>

    <updated>2005-07-20T14:04:14-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.spekkionu.com/2005/07/the-standard-metagame-the-lower-tiers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I looked at the tier 1 decks of Standard.  This week I&rsquo;ll be looking at the lower tiers.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I guess the first thing I should do is define what the tiers are and what separates them.  Tier 1 is obviously the best decks in the format.  In the current Standard I feel there are 4 tier 1 decks.  The first is Tooth which is above the others and could almost be considered something like Tier 0.  The rest of the tier 1 decks include Beacon Green, Flores Red, and Red Deck Wins.</p>

<p>A tier 2 deck is often still a very good deck.  It can be very powerful and often a good choice to play.  It just isn&rsquo;t quite as good as the tier 1 decks.  Decks I&rsquo;ll be including in this category include the Ninja Rats decks, White Weenie, Gifts Ungiven, B/G Control, and Mono Black Control.  These decks aren&rsquo;t as good as the 4 tier 1 decks but are also very common and more than capable of winning a tournament.  A few of these decks are closer to the tier 3 line such as WW and Mono Black Control but others are almost tier 1 decks like Ninja Rats and possibly Gifts Ungiven.  I guess if you could have a tier 1.5 and 2.5 this would be where these decks would fit in.</p>

<p>A tier 3 deck really includes a few different types of decks.  The first is just bad decks that people think are good.  Examples include Ponza and Mono Blue Control.  These decks may have been good at one time but they are currently a terrible choice for the metagame.  That wont stop them from winning a tournament here and there though.  Also note that when I say bad I don&rsquo;t actually mean the deck is worthless.  Just that they are currently  poor choices.  Mono Blue Control would probably be a tier 1 deck if <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boseiju,%20Who%20Shelters%20All&options=" data-card="Boseiju, Who Shelters All">Boseiju</a> didn&rsquo;t exist but as it is it just looses to decks that play it.  Ponza used to be great against Tooth with a good draw but since the deck added <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kodama&rsquo;s%20Reach&options=" data-card="Kodama&amp;rsquo;s Reach">Kodama&rsquo;s Reach</a> it isn&rsquo;t what it once was.  How can you expect land destruction to be good in a format where the most played cards are things like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sakura-Tribe%20Elder&options=" data-card="Sakura-Tribe Elder">Sakura-Tribe Elder</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kodama&rsquo;s%20Reach&options=" data-card="Kodama&amp;rsquo;s Reach">Kodama&rsquo;s Reach</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Eternal%20Witness&options=" data-card="Eternal Witness">Eternal Witness</a>, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sensei&rsquo;s%20Divining%20Top&options=" data-card="Sensei&amp;rsquo;s Divining Top">Sensei&rsquo;s Divining Top</a>? Even if the deck is good loosing to most tier 1 decks is generally enough to bump it down to a tier 3 deck.</p>

<p>The next type of tier 3 deck is a metagame deck.  These are generally rogue decks designed specifically to crush the metagame.  An example would be Joshie Green.  A deck like this usually wouldn&rsquo;t work at all if people were expecting them and came prepared.  This is generally the category you should aim for if you want to be a successful rogue player.</p>

<p>The last part just includes either brand new or otherwise underrepresented decks.  These decks can be good or bad but they are not common and thus not really worth preparing for.  Over time they will either disappear or find their place in the metagame.  Decks in this category right now include things like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Intruder%20Alarm&options=" data-card="Intruder Alarm">Intruder Alarm</a> decks and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Erayo,%20Soratami%20Ascendant&options=" data-card="Erayo, Soratami Ascendant">Erayo, Soratami Ascendant</a> decks.  It is possible a good build of one of these may eventually be found but right now they aren&rsquo;t very good.</p>

<h2>The Tier 2 Decks:</h2>

<h3>Ninja Rats:</h3>

<p>This is easily the best of the tier 2 decks and is almost good enough to be tier 1.  It has a very large amount of discard which is great against the control decks and reusing <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Nekrataal&options=" data-card="Nekrataal">Nekrataal</a> with ninjas and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Skull%20Collector&options=" data-card="Skull Collector">Skull Collector</a> is great against aggro decks.  The only reason it isn&rsquo;t completely tier 1 is that it is only semi-decent against Tooth.  The discard is great but cannot do anything about the Tooth deck just topdecking the win, which with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sensei&rsquo;s%20Divining%20Top&options=" data-card="Sensei&amp;rsquo;s Divining Top">Sensei&rsquo;s Divining Top</a> happens more than you would like.</p>

<p>The parts of this deck that generally vary are <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Skull%20Collector&options=" data-card="Skull Collector">Skull Collector</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Throat%20Slitter&options=" data-card="Throat Slitter">Throat Slitter</a>, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Okiba-Gang%20Shinobi&options=" data-card="Okiba-Gang Shinobi">Okiba-Gang Shinobi</a>.  Most run <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Throat%20Slitter&options=" data-card="Throat Slitter">Throat Slitter</a> over the discard ninja but since the environment is favoring more controlling decks I think the Shinobi is a bit better choice at the moment.</p>

<h3>White Weenie:</h3>

<p>One of the more overrated decks in the environment.  While it is good in Kamigawa Block Constructed this deck just doesn&rsquo;t have the power to really keep up in Standard.  The only reason it is even a  deck at all is <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hokori,%20Dust%20Drinker&options=" data-card="Hokori, Dust Drinker">Hokori, Dust Drinker</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Umezawa&rsquo;s%20Jitte&options=" data-card="Umezawa&amp;rsquo;s Jitte">Umezawa&rsquo;s Jitte</a>.  Jitte is strong but the green decks can use it just as well.  Hokori also has the problem of being a 4 drop in a deck that really doesn&rsquo;t want to be running 4-mana creatures.  This deck is certainly capable of winning games but not nearly to the extent as the green aggro decks do.</p>

<h3>B/G Control:</h3>

<p>This has been around since they printed <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Death%20Cloud&options=" data-card="Death Cloud">Death Cloud</a>.  It has always been floating there at the pretty good but not great level.  There are certainly very powerful cards available for this deck and it can be quite good.  It is a bit slow however and can be pretty bad if it doesn&rsquo;t get decent draws.</p>

<h3>Mono Black Control:</h3>

<p>This one hasn&rsquo;t really made a name for itself at a good deck yet.  Don&rsquo;t let that make you think it isn&rsquo;t a powerful deck though.  While it can have problems against  a lucky topdeck from Tooth it is usually quite good against the best decks.  It can dominate the aggro green decks in the environment.  It can have a problem against the fast red decks though.</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t really an agreed upon built of this deck yet but this one looked the most generic to me.

<p>Since this deck can run literally any card in Standard they tend to vary a lot.  You can find anything from Sunburst cards to just a bunch of good creatures from various colors.  Really the only thing they all have is the mana fixing and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gifts%20Ungiven&options=" data-card="Gifts Ungiven">Gifts Ungiven</a>.  Since Gifts is a tutor there tend to be a huge number of one-of silver bullets these decks run.</p>

<h2>Tier 3 Decks:</h2>

<p>From last week&rsquo;s article Joshie Green and Ponza would fit into this category.  I put them into that article because it isn&rsquo;t always obvious as to the difference between those decks and similar ones that are tier 1.  For instance Joshie Green isn&rsquo;t Beacon Green even though it is a mono green aggro deck that runs <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Beacon%20of%20Creation&options=" data-card="Beacon of Creation">Beacon of Creation</a>.  Ponza isn&rsquo;t always distinguishable from Red Deck Wins either.  Really the only difference is often just the amount of land destruction and then you have to decide where to draw the line.  It would be obvious that a deck with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Stone%20Rain&options=" data-card="Stone Rain">Stone Rain</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Molten%20Rain&options=" data-card="Molten Rain">Molten Rain</a>, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Demolish&options=" data-card="Demolish">Demolish</a> is Ponza but what about one with just the first two?  Mana Red Deck Wins decks run <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Molten%20Rain&options=" data-card="Molten Rain">Molten Rain</a> so running 4 land destruction spells doesn&rsquo;t make it Ponza but running 8 is a bit more borderline.</p>

<h3>Mono Blue Control:</h3>

<p>This was considered the best deck right after Affinity was banned and was even one of the better decks in the Ravager Affinity dominated environment.  Now it isn&rsquo;t even tier 2.  This deck is down here for one reason and that is <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boseiju,%20Who%20Shelters%20All&options=" data-card="Boseiju, Who Shelters All">Boseiju</a>.  That single card takes the Tooth matchup from very good to completely unwinnable.  Nine mana sorceries usually don&rsquo;t see play because under normal circumstances it would just get countered.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boseiju,%20Who%20Shelters%20All&options=" data-card="Boseiju, Who Shelters All">Boseiju</a> negates that completely.  Suddenly the blue mage has to just watch <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tooth%20and%20Nail&options=" data-card="Tooth and Nail">Tooth and Nail</a> resolve while staring helplessly at the countermagic it is holding.  The other problem is <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thieving%20Magpie&options=" data-card="Thieving Magpie">Thieving Magpie</a>.  I believe that running it is a terrible idea.  What kind of Draw.Go deck would tap out on turn 3-4 to cast a creature?  This is generally where the opponent untaps and drops <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kodama%20of%20the%20North%20Tree&options=" data-card="Kodama of the North Tree">Kodama of the North Tree</a> or something else scary.  Also dropping <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vedalken%20Shackles&options=" data-card="Vedalken Shackles">Vedalken Shackles</a> as soon as you hit 3 mana is an equally bad idea.  Yet people continue to do so.  This deck would actually not be so bad if people would just play a decent version of it.  There were 3 lists in the top 8s of Regionals that weren&rsquo;t the &ldquo;Turbo Magpie&rdquo; decks that are most commonly seen.  As a result Mono Blue Control was one of the worst performing decks in Regionals.  I read somewhere in a pre Regionals article that in the past few big tournaments the deck had posted something like a 38% win rate.  This was bumped up to 52% if you only looked at the versions not running <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thieving%20Magpie&options=" data-card="Thieving Magpie">Thieving Magpie</a>.</p>

<p>For a decent version look at running something more like <a href="http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/9982.html">this</a>.</p>

<h3>Mono Blue Urzatron:</h3>

<p>This deck is actually pretty cool.  It runs the same countermagic that mono blue control tends to have but also uses the Urzatron to cast big powerful spells like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mindslaver&options=" data-card="Mindslaver">Mindslaver</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Triskelion&options=" data-card="Triskelion">Triskelion</a>.  This isn&rsquo;t a great deck but is probably one of the better Tier 3 decks.  At the very least it is better than Mono Blue Control.  Really the more I think about it the more I think this should have been in the tier 2 section.</p>

</div></div></p>

<p>This deck has a few oddities like not maindecking <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Triskelion&options=" data-card="Triskelion">Triskelion</a> but some of the extra cards it runs are good like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=%C3%86ther%20Spellbomb&options=" data-card="Æther Spellbomb">Æther Spellbomb</a> and it doesn&rsquo;t run some of the mediocre cards that other versions do like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Arcbound%20Reclaimer&options=" data-card="Arcbound Reclaimer">Arcbound Reclaimer</a>.  Generally this is to recur <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mindslaver&options=" data-card="Mindslaver">Mindslaver</a> but that is really all that card is good for.  This version doesn&rsquo;t run it but one of the neat things many of these decks do is run <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Twincast&options=" data-card="Twincast">Twincast</a>, one <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Uyo,%20Silent%20Prophet&options=" data-card="Uyo, Silent Prophet">Uyo, Silent Prophet</a> and 2 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mephidross%20Vampire&options=" data-card="Mephidross Vampire">Mephidross Vampires</a> in the sideboard for the Tooth matchup.  If you are holding <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Twincast&options=" data-card="Twincast">Twincast</a> the Tooth deck pretty much cannot cast <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tooth%20and%20Nail&options=" data-card="Tooth and Nail">Tooth and Nail</a> without giving you the game.  Of course if they board <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tooth%20and%20Nail&options=" data-card="Tooth and Nail">Tooth and Nail</a> out for creatures like many people are doing now days I&rsquo;m not sure if this deck is still favored.  They are much better at finding Urza pieces than you are.</p>

<h3>Erayo Affinity:</h3>

<p>This is by far the weirdest deck to make top 8 at Regionals.  While there was only one it is still worth pointing out just because it is kinda cool.  This deck can flip <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Erayo,%20Soratami%20Ascendant&options=" data-card="Erayo, Soratami Ascendant">Erayo, Soratami Ascendant</a> as early as turn 2 with a good draw.  Once flipped <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Erayo,%20Soratami%20Ascendant&options=" data-card="Erayo, Soratami Ascendant">Erayo</a> will make the opponent have problems doing much of anything.  The person who played this deck to the top 8 really just got lucky and still doesn&rsquo;t think much of the deck other than it is fun to play.</p>

<h3>Intruder Alarm Combo:</h3>

<p>This has been around for a while but hasn&rsquo;t really made much of a splash.  It is likely the best combo deck in the environment, unless you consider Tooth a combo deck (it is really part combo part control).  It is actually pretty good but would likely disappear if enough people played it for others to devote sideboard slots to it.  As it is it is one of the better rogue options.  The goal is to animate <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Forbidden%20Orchard&options=" data-card="Forbidden Orchard">Forbidden Orchard</a> with an <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Intruder%20Alarm&options=" data-card="Intruder Alarm">Intruder Alarm</a> in play for infinite mana or get out<a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kiki-Jiki,%20Mirror%20Breaker&options=" data-card="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker">Kiki-Jiki</a> + <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Intruder%20Alarm&options=" data-card="Intruder Alarm">Intruder Alarm</a> for infinite hasty copies of another creature you control.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>Any of the tier 2 decks and the Blue Urzatron deck are more than capable of winning a big tournament.  The rest are more just kinda cool to look at and might be fun to play but aren&rsquo;t really all that good.  Any deck here would be fine for a more casual environment like Friday Night Magic or something of similar competitiveness.  Regionals was the last look of Standard before 9th Edition comes out which will hopefully bring about a few changes in the environment.  I should probably do some kind of post 9th Standard deckbuilding article before that happens so I&rsquo;ll be thinking about some new ideas.  Preferably ones that utilize some new card in 9th <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wildfire&options=" data-card="Wildfire">Wildfire</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shard%20Phoenix&options=" data-card="Shard Phoenix">Shard Phoenix</a> certainly have my intrigue right now).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the next few articles I&rsquo;ll be looking at the Standard environment and what the top decks are as well as a few of the more roguish decks.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I&rsquo;ll be using the results for Regionals as an indicator of the metagame.</p>

<p>First up is the most obvious and clearly the best deck in the format.</p>

<h2>Tooth and Nail:</h2>

<p>66 of the top 8 decks at US Regionals were Tooth decks making by far the most common deck to find in the top 8.  Not anywhere near as bad as Regionals last year where Ravager Affinity was something like 4-5 slots in every top 8 but still a significant number.  It is most assuredly the deck to beat.</p>

<p>A standard Tooth list looks something like this:</p>

<p>This is a pretty basic list and by far the most common configuration.</p>

<p>There really isn&rsquo;t a huge amount of variance between builds.  It used to be that there was a few choices to make about which creatures you ran to Tooth into but even those are becoming more standard.  Most versions are running a second <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sundering%20Titan&options=" data-card="Sundering Titan">Sundering Titan</a> over the <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Darksteel%20Colossus&options=" data-card="Darksteel Colossus">Darksteel Colossus</a> and practically no versions are running the <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Platinum%20Angel&options=" data-card="Platinum Angel">Platinum Angel</a> <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Leonin%20Abunas&options=" data-card="Leonin Abunas">Leonin Abunas</a> combo anymore.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mephidross%20Vampire&options=" data-card="Mephidross Vampire">Mephidross Vampire</a> is often in the sideboard but rarely main decked.  You occasionally find a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rude%20Awakening&options=" data-card="Rude Awakening">Rude Awakening</a> or two in the maindeck as well usually over a few <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mindslaver&options=" data-card="Mindslaver">Mindslavers</a>.  Also <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kodama&rsquo;s%20Reach&options=" data-card="Kodama&amp;rsquo;s Reach">Kodama&rsquo;s Reach</a> is a fairly new addition to the deck since Terry Soh ran it in the Invitational (which he won).  They became standard pretty quickly though and most decks have them.</p>

<p>Where the decks tend to actually vary is in the sideboard.  Terry Soh provided the Troll and Nail sideboard.  The theory was that every deck was sideboarding heavily against Tooth by bringing in land destruction spells like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Molten%20Rain&options=" data-card="Molten Rain">Molten Rain</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sowing%20Salt&options=" data-card="Sowing Salt">Sowing Salt</a>.  When playing the mirror or against red decks The Troll and Nail decks would board out all its copies of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tooth%20and%20Nail&options=" data-card="Tooth and Nail">Tooth and Nail</a> and the tooth targets for <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plow%20Under&options=" data-card="Plow Under">Plow Under</a> and a bunch of fatties, generally including <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Troll%20Ascetic&options=" data-card="Troll Ascetic">Troll Ascetic</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Razormane%20Masticore&options=" data-card="Razormane Masticore">Razormane Masticore</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Molder%20Slug&options=" data-card="Molder Slug">Molder Slug</a>, and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Iwamori%20Of%20The%20Open%20Fist&options=" data-card="Iwamori Of The Open Fist">Iwamori Of The Open Fist</a>.  The actual fatties tend to vary (as you can see in this list) but the plan itself is fairly standard.  The fat would make the land destruction much less useful (as you are no longer trying to cast a 9 mana Sorcery) and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plow%20Under&options=" data-card="Plow Under">Plow Under</a> would make the mirror much better.  Just don&rsquo;t bring in the fat against decks that lose to <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tooth%20and%20Nail&options=" data-card="Tooth and Nail">Tooth and Nail</a> as that would be stupid.  Black decks have a much easier time <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Terror&options=" data-card="Terror">Terroring</a> <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Molder%20Slug&options=" data-card="Molder Slug">Molder Slug</a> than they do of dealing with <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sundering%20Titan&options=" data-card="Sundering Titan">Sundering Titan</a> so leave the fatties in the board and be happy you beat them anyway.  Green players also have more problems with the Tooth plan than the fatty plan as its own fatties are usually bigger and more numerous.</p>

<p>The basic game plan of Tooth is simple; Get to 9 mana and cast <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tooth%20and%20Nail&options=" data-card="Tooth and Nail">Tooth and Nail</a> with entwine.  You then throw some creatures into play that tend to win the game.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sundering%20Titan&options=" data-card="Sundering Titan">Sundering Titan</a> + <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kiki-Jiki,%20Mirror%20Breaker&options=" data-card="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker">Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker</a> is by far the most common Tooth targets as they tend to blow up all the opponent&rsquo;s land and give you 14 damage a turn.  The game will be over quickly.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kiki-Jiki,%20Mirror%20Breaker&options=" data-card="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker">Kiki-Jiki</a> + <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Darksteel%20Colossus&options=" data-card="Darksteel Colossus">Darksteel Colossus</a> will kill the opponent next turn.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kiki-Jiki,%20Mirror%20Breaker&options=" data-card="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker">Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker</a> + <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Duplicant&options=" data-card="Duplicant">Duplicant</a> or <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Triskelion&options=" data-card="Triskelion">Triskelion</a> will deal with pretty much any creatures.

The reason it isn&rsquo;t common that a 9 mana sorcery sees tournament play is that under normal circumstances if you try to cast it your opponent will just tap a few <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Island&options=" data-card="Island">Islands</a> and counter it.  Right now though there is the first fact that Wizards has been actively hosing countermagic.  Then there is the other problem that all the Tooth player needs to do is use one of his 7+ non-basic land searchers to find a Boseju and suddenly the blue player is completely powerless to stop <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tooth%20and%20Nail&options=" data-card="Tooth and Nail">Tooth and Nail</a> from resolving.

<h2>Mono Red Decks:</h2>

<p>There are actually 3 different decks in this category and I&rsquo;ll go over each individually.  Overall though this was the second most common deck in the top 8 at US Regionals and with good reason.  These decks are good against Tooth.  Just beating the best deck in the format alone is enough of a reason for a deck to at least be tier 2.  Red also has access to the possible best creature in the format, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Arc-Slogger&options=" data-card="Arc-Slogger">Arc-Slogger</a> and plenty of other powerful cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pulse%20of%20the%20Forge&options=" data-card="Pulse of the Forge">Pulse of the Forge</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shrapnel%20Blast&options=" data-card="Shrapnel Blast">Shrapnel Blast</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Slith%20Firewalker&options=" data-card="Slith Firewalker">Slith Firewalker</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Genju%20of%20the%20Spires&options=" data-card="Genju of the Spires">Genju of the Spires</a>.</p>

<h3>Red Deck Wins:</h3>

<p>If it is possible for this type of deck to be built in a format then it probably will.  A lot of people just love this type of fast aggressive red aggro deck.  Really all it needs to succeed it some decent weenies and cheap burn.  Both are available right now.  A common list would look something like this:</p>

<p>Probably the scariest thing this deck can do is turn 1 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Slith%20Firewalker&options=" data-card="Slith Firewalker">Slith Firewalker</a>.  This is something that pretty much any deck hates to see and can often be game over against a slower deck as by the time you have a blocker out the Slith is too big to deal with.  Play just involves swinging with men and burning things, whether blockers or going to the dome.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vulshok%20Sorcerer&options=" data-card="Vulshok Sorcerer">Vulshok Sorcerer</a> is good in the mirror, against WW, and against all the fast aggro green decks.  Considering how many decks are running cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kodama&rsquo;s%20Reach&options=" data-card="Kodama&amp;rsquo;s Reach">Kodama&rsquo;s Reach</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sakura-Tribe%20Elder&options=" data-card="Sakura-Tribe Elder">Sakura-Tribe Elder</a> it is no wonder <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Zo-Zu%20The%20Punisher&options=" data-card="Zo-Zu The Punisher">Zo-Zu The Punisher</a> is good.  This type of deck is also noticeable by its very low mana curve and lack of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Arc-Slogger&options=" data-card="Arc-Slogger">Arc-Slogger</a>.  This is also the most common type of red deck to make the top 8.</p>

<h3>Ponza:</h3>

<p>This deck is quite similar to Red Deck Wins except it is much more focused on land destruction.  While other red decks might run <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Molten%20Rain&options=" data-card="Molten Rain">Molten Rain</a>, Ponza tries to squeeze in as much land destruction as possible.  Generally 4 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Molten%20Rain&options=" data-card="Molten Rain">Molten Rain</a>, 4 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Stone%20Rain&options=" data-card="Stone Rain">Stone Rain</a>, and some number of <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Demolish&options=" data-card="Demolish">Demolish</a>.  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sowing%20Salt&options=" data-card="Sowing Salt">Sowing Salt</a> is also occasionally found in the main deck but not as much as it used to be.  Also unlike the other two deck types this one isn&rsquo;t tier 1 and possibly isn&rsquo;t even tier 2 anymore.  It has great game against Tooth in game 1 but if they have the fatty sideboard that Terry Soh invented they lose that advantage after boarding.  The deck doesn&rsquo;t really have any other favorable tier 1 matchups.  Many people believe this to just be a bad deck right now.  I tend to agree.  An example would be something like this:</p>

<p>These decks varied a lot in many ways.

<h3>Flores Red:</h3>

<p>This deck debuted in a Mike Flores article back in May.  It hasn&rsquo;t changed much since then.  In fact I used the original maindeck for the list here and just pasted in a more current sideboard.  The deck is based on Kuroda Masashiro&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgevent/ptkob04/fin">winning deck</a> from Pro Tour Kobe last year (beating out the first Tooth deck making its debut).</p>

</div></div></p>

<p>The deck runs only 8 creatures and half of those are really just there as mana acceleration and chump blockers.  Generally the game is won either by <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Arc-Slogger&options=" data-card="Arc-Slogger">Arc-Slogger</a> or a couple of large burn spells.  Rather than go for small spells like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shock&options=" data-card="Shock">Shock</a> this deck grabs the big stuff.  With  11 spells that do 4+ damage this deck is quite capable of randomly burning out opponents (which Flores refers to as Reach).  One of the strongest arguments for this deck is that it is much more consistent than the other types of red decks.  Ponza is actually a terrible deck unless you get a good draw and Red Deck Wins can fizzle out pretty easily.  This deck also is one of the decks that can best abuse <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sensei&rsquo;s%20Divining%20Top&options=" data-card="Sensei&amp;rsquo;s Divining Top">Sensei&rsquo;s Divining Top</a>.  This deck has 15 cards that can get rid of dead cards from the top of the deck.  Also just as useful if you don&rsquo;t need the Top anymore you can just use it to feed <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shrapnel%20Blast&options=" data-card="Shrapnel Blast">Shrapnel Blast</a>.  A bonus tip:  If you put the card drawing ability of the Top on the stack and respond by sacking the Top to <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shrapnel%20Blast&options=" data-card="Shrapnel Blast">Shrapnel Blast</a> still draw a card and don&rsquo;t have a stupid Top clogging the top of your deck.  Opinions of this deck differ wildly.  Some claim it to be the best deck in the format.  Others claim it to be a total pile of crap.  Having a bit of experience playing with it I&rsquo;m a bit closer to the former but wouldn&rsquo;t go as far as to say it is the best deck.  It is definitely tier 1 though.</p>

<h2>Mono Green Aggro:</h2>

<p>There are also multiple mono green aggro decks (AKA not Tooth).  The first group are almost just good stuff decks with a big pile of broken/powerful green cards.  The second eschews all disruption and seeks to be more like the stompy decks of old.  Just pure aggression.</p>

<h3>Beacon Green:</h3>

<p>This is by far the more common of the two aggro green decks.  This is also often called medium green as it doesn&rsquo;t rely on <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Beacon%20of%20Creation&options=" data-card="Beacon of Creation">Beacon of Creation</a> as much as older versions that also used <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Blasting%20Station&options=" data-card="Blasting Station">Blasting Station</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fecundity&options=" data-card="Fecundity">Fecundity</a> for a kind of pinging combo (the original version also used <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Skullclamp&options=" data-card="Skullclamp">Skullclamp</a>).</p>

<h3>Joshie Green:</h3>

<p>This deck was created by Jamie Wakefield and his friend (whom the deck is named after).  It pretty much destroys anything with Forests in it but auto looses to black and mono blue.  Mono blue is a near dead archetype and black isn&rsquo;t very common at the moment and this deck crushes Tooth, Beacon Green, and has a great matchup against mono red as well.  It just looses to the crappy rouge decks.  This is fine on the Pro Tour where less people go rouge but in a more casual tournament environment like Friday Night Magic or States and Regionals running this deck is likely not a good idea.  Due to this it is more likely a Tier 2-3 deck than tier 1 but is still a perfectly fine metagame deck.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today&rsquo;s article is all about the red deck.  I&rsquo;ll go though the various different types of red decks and the differences between them.  I wont go into too much detail in the history because there is no way I could do a better job than <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/mf39">Mike Flores</a>.  I suggest you give that article a read first.</p>

<p>Probably the weirdest thing about the red decks is how people blindly label them all the same thing.  The common labels that get thrown around incorrectly are Sligh, Red Deck Wins, and Ponza.  Goblins is the other deck I&rsquo;ll cover but it tends to be a bit more obvious and doesn&rsquo;t get mislabeled like the others.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>I&rsquo;ll go over the oldest deck first.  That deck is Jay Schneider&rsquo;s Geeba deck piloted by Paul Sligh.  This deck was eventually named after the person who was successful with it and is now known as Sligh.</p>

<p>That deck looks like a piece of crap doesn&rsquo;t it?  <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblins%20of%20the%20Flarg&options=" data-card="Goblins of the Flarg">Goblins of the Flarg</a> in the same deck as <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dwarven%20Lieutenant&options=" data-card="Dwarven Lieutenant">Dwarven Lieutenant</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dwarven%20Trader&options=" data-card="Dwarven Trader">Dwarven Trader</a>?  One random <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shatter&options=" data-card="Shatter">Shatter</a> and a <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Detonate&options=" data-card="Detonate">Detonate</a>?  This is a weird deck for sure.  One thing to keep in mind is that at the time you were forced to use 5 cards minimum from each legal set which explains some of the oddities (though not all of them).</p>

<p>Something even more important about this deck is that it is nothing like the decks people call Sligh now days.  This isn&rsquo;t an all-out aggro weenie rush strategy deck.  This is much more of an aggro control deck.  It is about board control.  It uses burn and cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Brothers%20of%20Fire&options=" data-card="Brothers of Fire">Brothers of Fire</a> and <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Orcish%20Artillery&options=" data-card="Orcish Artillery">Orcish Artillery</a> to control the board while it attacks with a few little men.  So what deck do we normally think of when someone says Sligh?  That would be the next aggressive red deck to pop up, Deadguy Red.</p>

<p>This deck, played by David Price, is the aggressive weenie deck that most people think of when they talk about Sligh.  It was amazing against the Necro decks that dominated at the time.  Decks like this were at their best during Tempest/Mirrage type 2 where they looked something like this.</p>

<p>This deck was called Sligh by practically everyone during this era but was not really a Sligh deck.  It was much more of a Deadguy Red deck.  It eventually got even more aggressive and dropped <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hammer%20of%20Bogardan&options=" data-card="Hammer of Bogardan">Hammer of Bogardan</a> and started running <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Giant%20Strength&options=" data-card="Giant Strength">Giant Strength</a> to combat <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bottle%20Gnomes&options=" data-card="Bottle Gnomes">Bottle Gnomes</a>.</p>

<p>Another red deck that popped up later is Ponza.  This deck typically runs a bunch of dudes and some land destruction.  The deck is pretty good in a very control heavy metagame but land destruction is historically weak against aggro.  The past versions running <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wildfire&options=" data-card="Wildfire">Wildfire</a> had much more game against the average aggro deck than many of the versions around today.  In the current standard the deck is good against Tooth but is pretty crappy against everything else, making it a poor choice.  I don&rsquo;t want to cover this one too much so I&rsquo;ll move on to some other red decks.</p>

<p>Next up is Red Deck Wins.</p>

<p>Rather than using cards like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Stone%20Rain&options=" data-card="Stone Rain">Stone Rain</a> to disrupt mana bases, Red Deck Wins uses things like <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rishadan%20Port&options=" data-card="Rishadan Port">Rishadan Port</a>, <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wasteland&options=" data-card="Wasteland">Wasteland</a>, and occasionally <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tangle%20Wire&options=" data-card="Tangle Wire">Tangle Wire</a>.  The strongest part of this deck is its ability to punish a deck with a less than stellar draw.  It is slower than other red decks like Goblins but makes up for that with disruption.  The fetchlands not only thin the deck of land but also power up <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Grim%20Lavamancer&options=" data-card="Grim Lavamancer">Grim Lavamancer</a>.

<p>This deck is actually quite amazing and Flores claims it to likely be the best deck in Standard right now.  It has game against practically every tier 1 Standard deck.  Osyp ran this Flores design (well one card away from it) in the Standard portion of the Invitational to a 3-0 record (despite being in last place).  I&rsquo;ve tested it a bit as well and it is indeed quite solid.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of people claiming red aggro decks like Deadguy Red or Sligh are brainless to both build and play and require no skill.  I used to believe this to be true as well but given more exposure to the archetype have developed much more respect for it.  First reading articles by people like Flores or Dan Paskins who love these types of decks and often talk about the deeper strategies involved in both building and playing the decks gave me the curiosity that they might not be as brainless as they seemed. The real proof though came in watching pro tour coverage, specifically Masashiro Kuroda playing red decks.  The things I have seen him do with the red deck are nothing short of amazing.  I&rsquo;ve seen him overcome turn 1 <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Akroma,%20Angel%20of%20Wrath&options=" data-card="Akroma, Angel of Wrath">Akroma, Angel of Wrath</a>.  I&rsquo;ve seen opponents cast <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Chill&options=" data-card="Chill">Chill</a> on turn 2, 3, and a third on turn 4 against his mono red deck and watch him win anyway.  In his hands the deck is a beautiful thing to watch and brings me a great respect for it I never had before.  David Price may be known as the King of Beatdown but Kuroda turns it into an art form.  I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve seen some more amazing things from him at some Extended tournament in which he played Red Deck Wins but I can&rsquo;t remember what tournament that was so if you want to see Kuroda in action I&rsquo;ll either point you to the Invitational coverage (in which he only did slightly above average) or the video coverage for <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgevent/ptkob04/welcome">Pro Tour Kobe</a> at the tournament dominated by Affinity and the brand new 12-Post deck (Just known as Tooth in Standard since most of those versions run the Urzatron over <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cloudpost&options=" data-card="Cloudpost">Cloudpost</a>).</p>

<p>I was going to finish by building a red deck for Standard but after playing around with it I determined that mine would really just be the same as Flores Big Red with only a few cards changed (I don&rsquo;t like the random <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Two-Headed%20Dragon&options=" data-card="Two-Headed Dragon">Two-Headed Dragon</a> / <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sowing%20Salt&options=" data-card="Sowing Salt">Sowing Salt</a> depending on the version you look at and in testing <a class="mtg-card-link" rel="#mtg-card-popup" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shrapnel%20Blast&options=" data-card="Shrapnel Blast">Shrapnel Blast</a> was unkind to me).</p>
